      "raw": "Bose’s entry-level soundbar features a compact design, making it a great fit for small bedrooms. | Image: Bose\t\n\nIf you’re looking to upgrade your movie night, a soundbar is an easy way to beef up the audio. While there are some high-priced options out there, you don’t have to spend a lot to actually hear a movie’s dialog. Right now, the Bose TV Speaker is down to $163.45 (about $115 off) at Amazon, the lowest price we’ve seen yet.\nBose TV Speaker\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $279 $163.45 at Amazon\n $279 $199 at Bose\n $279 $199.99 at Best Buy\n\nThe Bose TV Speaker is a solid starter soundbar that can easily integrate into existing setups with a simple one-cable connection (via optical or HDMI). At under 24 inches wide and around two inches tall, the soundbar features a small footprint, yet it delivers a rich, immersive sound thanks to its three-speaker setup. For more bass, you can press the “Bass” button on the remote, while a dedicated dialogue mode further elevates what people are saying, allowing you to finally turn off the subtitles.\nAdditionally, the Bose TV Speaker has Bluetooth connectivity, so you can use the soundbar to listen to music or podcasts. While it lacks more premium features like Dolby Atmos, Bose offers some of our favorite noise-cancelling headphones and earbuds, so you can expect a similar level of quality in its home audio products.\nOther weekend discounts\nTwelve South’s 4-foot PowerCord is currently down to an all-time low of $26.86 (about $13 off) at Amazon. The PowerCord combines a USB-C cable and a 30W wall adapter, so you no longer need to carry them separately. It supports Power Delivery 3.0, providing fast charging to the latest smartphones — it can charge an iPhone 16 from 0 to 55 percent in just 30 minutes. Meanwhile, the PowerCord features a durable braided cable that connects to the bottom of the adapter, so it doesn’t awkwardly poke out from the wall.\nThere are several great controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 beyond the Switch 2 Pro Controller. One of them is the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller, which is currently down to $59.99 ($10 off) at Amazon — a few bucks more than the all-time low we saw over Prime Day. The controller packs more reliable TMR joysticks, Hall effect triggers, extra R4 / L4 bumpers, and rear paddle buttons. It also comes with a 2.4GHz dongle and charging dock, making the controller easy to charge between gaming sessions.\nIf you’re not quite ready for a full-fledged smartwatch, the Casio G-Shock Move DW-H5600 is a nice compromise — and it’s currently down to $183.72 (about $115 off) at Amazon, the best price we’ve seen all year. The DW-H5600 includes a sensor that can measure your heart rate, sleep, blood oxygen levels, and active time. It can also feed you basic smartphone notifications, so you can keep tabs on incoming calls and emails.",

      "raw": "Not all of  The Verge’s staff live in the US. For example, news editor Dominic Preston is based in London and is, as he says, “responsible for keeping our news coverage ticking over in UK mornings before the US team comes online.” He also curates our new Verge Daily newsletter and covers Android phones, especially all the models that don’t launch in the US. \nAnd outside of work? “I’m a bit of a food obsessive,” he says, “and run a newsletter called Braise where I review London restaurants and cookbooks, and occasionally try my own hand at recipe writing. That means I spend most of my free time cooking, eating, or thinking about food, and so also a decent amount of time in the gym trying to make up for that.” \nWhere is your workspace located?\nThis is an office that I share with my partner in our flat in London. It used to be a second bedroom, but now we’ve kitted it out with two desks and a sofa bed for the occasional times we actually have guests to stay. My partner is a PhD student, so her working hours are a bit unpredictable, and split between here and school — which means that 90 percent of the time I’ve got the office to myself.\nCould you tell us about your desk(s)?\nWe both have standing desks. Mine is an Autonomous SmartDesk 2 that’s electronic and automatic, hers an old pneumatic model by Bakker Elkhuizen that they don’t make anymore, which annoys her because it requires a bit of effort to shift up and down. They’re both decorated with self-healing cutting mats, which are still occasionally used for arts and crafts (or as the backdrop for my product photos) but mostly double as giant mouse mats.\nYou have both a chair and a walking station. What are they, and how well do they work for you?\nThe chair is a secondhand Herman Miller. It actually used to be my partner’s, while I sat in a big Duelhawk Jet Black PU gaming chair (also no longer available), until we each realized we preferred the other’s seat and swapped. I’m old enough, and sore enough, to be willing to invest a little in the chair I’ll be using every day anyway.\nThe walking pad is a pretty cheap one from Mobvoi. I actually bought it immediately after reading a piece by my colleague Victoria Song on a different Mobvoi model, and following her advice I’ve made no attempt to touch its smart features or track my workouts; so far it’s served me well. I just use it as slow as it goes, and try to spend as much of every morning walking on it as possible — on a good day I’ll rack up two or three hours of steady walking time; on a bad day I’ll keep putting it off until the coffee hits and never quite get going. Either way, I let myself sit down for the afternoon, which is more likely to be concentrated writing time — I find it hard to do anything too creative or complicated while walking at the same time.\n(I know, I know, my cable management isn’t great. I tend to be very tidy, but cables are one of the few things I absolutely don’t have the patience to organize. Sadly, having a standing desk really lays bare those sins, so I may have to force myself to get better about it.)\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the long one: tell us about the various tech devices you’re using. \nMy current setup is slightly awkwardly trapped between my work and personal computers, though I have some plans in the works to improve it.\nMy work machine is an M2 MacBook Air, which lives propped up on a Ugreen laptop stand. It’s connected to the monitor on the right, a cheap 24-inch QHD Philips model that I bought in 2020. \nThe confusing part of my setup is that second monitor, an embarrassingly old Acer one. That’s because I’ve also got a desktop PC that I use outside of work, and that connects to both monitors. At the end of the work day I can flip the MacBook shut, and my personal setup is good to go. It’s all unnecessarily cluttered, though, especially since the MacBook can’t support both external monitors at once, so this year’s big upgrade will probably be a 32-inch 4K monitor to replace the pair of them. I’ll happily take any recommendations from the comments!\nMy keyboard is the Logitech MX Keys S, which I love. I’m as much of a sucker for a good mechanical board as the next guy, but I love low-profile, full-size keyboards, and good mechanical options in that space are few and far between. I used to use a Hexgears Venture, but I ran it into the ground eventually, and this has served me well since.\nLogitech MX Keys S\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129.99 at Amazon\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n $129.99 at Logitech\n\nThe mouse is also Logitech, though it isn’t my usual one. I picked up this MX Anywhere 3S a while back to use when I’m traveling to trade shows and product launches, and usually have the larger MX Master 3S on my desk. Sadly the left button on that has given up the ghost, and I’m holding off on replacing it in the hopes that the long-rumored MX Master 4 is about to launch.\nContinuing the Logitech theme (I’m just now realizing quite how much of my desk setup was built by them), I have an old Z337 2.1 speaker system that just barely fits on the desk right now (another reason I need to switch to a single monitor), and a Brio 500 webcam that I mostly like for how easy it is to flip the built-in privacy shutter.\nEverything connects up through an Anker Prime USB hub that’s almost certainly more powerful than I need it to be, but has lots of front-facing USB ports for charging my array of phones, helped by a Xiaomi 50W wireless charging stand, which made more sense when I was using a Xiaomi 14 Ultra as my main phone, but is slightly wasted now — other phones don’t hit that max charging speed.\nAnker Prime Charging Docking Station\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $269.99 $169.99 at Amazon\n $269.99 $169.99 at Anker (with code WS7DV27TLOVQ)\n\nI tend to have a rotating cast of phones floating around my desk, though this is relatively tidy for me — on messy days I can have up to five or six handsets taking up space. Beyond the Vivo X200 Ultra I used to take these photos, you can see the Fairphone 6 and Huawei Pura X, the two phones I’ve most recently been testing for reviews. \nTell us about your camera collection.\nI decided I wanted to try out film photography back in 2019, because I was spending a lot more time writing about cameras as part of my phone reviews and using cameras as part of my job. I figured film would be a good way to make myself learn more about the core principles. \nI picked up this Canon EF on eBay. It’s a ’70s SLR with a metal body, which means it’s heavy but is built like a tank — I suspect it will outlast me. It came with a Canon 50mm lens, and I’ve gradually picked up a few cheap options to go with it: a 28mm wide-angle, a 35-70mm for when I want flexibility, and a 70-210mm telephoto I bought specifically for a safari in Kenya a couple years back. I always tell myself I’ll buy better-quality lenses when I’m a good enough photographer to get the most out of them, but I’ll probably just have to bite the bullet eventually.\nThe microphone living alongside them all is the Rode NT-USB, which I use for podcasts and videos, though I’d like to get a boom arm for it so I can store it around the desk.\nYou’ve got a lot of toys and games on those shelves! How long have you been collecting them?\nThis is a really motley assortment of things I’ve collected over the years — some bought, some gifted, some acquired from an old office clearout. There’s more dotted around the rest of my apartment, though my girlfriend is on an (understandable) mission to concentrate it all in the office.\nDo you have any favorites?\nI’m an absolute Alien obsessive, and I actually have two full-size facehuggers, one plushie and one vinyl, which I adore. There’s also a (sadly not full-size) power loader from Aliens, which I can’t get enough of. Elsewhere in the apartment I have a few original ’90s Street Sharks and Small Soldiers action figures, which are still waiting for the right shelf to display them on.\nThe board game collection is small but steadily growing. I’ve been playing a lot of Gloomhaven over the last year or so, though Betrayal at House on the Hill is probably the game that gets broken out most often. I’ve also got a healthy collection of D&D 5e and Alien RPG sourcebooks — I can strongly recommend the latter, and that’s not just the fanboy in me speaking!\nOkay, tell us about that beautiful cat. \nThat’s Noodle, one of our two cats (the other is Loaf, and yes, of course they have an Instagram account).\n\nNoodle doesn’t mind when the standing desk rises.\n\nShe’s actually a recent addition to my desk. We’ve had the cats for a couple of years, but in the last few months Noodle has decided she really wants to hang out with me while I work, and will happily lie down on my keyboard to do so. We set her up with a little blanket bed instead, which she now sleeps in about half the day, though she still isn’t above a keyboard nap when the mood strikes. The biggest surprise to me is that she doesn’t seem to mind the standing desk going up or down while she’s on it, which I expected would cause a bit of panic.\nPhotographs by Dominic Preston / The Verge",

      "raw": "Apple is suing a former employee on the Apple Watch team who left to join Oppo, alleging that he “conspired to steal Apple’s trade secrets relating to Apple Watch and to disclose them to his new employers.”\nAhead of starting his new job at Oppo, the employee, Dr. Chen Shi, attended “dozens” of meetings with technical members on the Apple Watch team to learn about their work and downloaded 63 documents “from a protected Box folder” that he loaded onto a USB drive, according to the lawsuit. Shi allegedly sent a message to Oppo saying that he was working to “collect as much information as possible” before starting his job. And he searched the internet for terms like “how to wipe out macbook” and “Can somebody see if I’ve opened a file on a shared drive?” from his Apple-issued MacBook before leaving the company.\nShi was formerly a sensor system architect at Apple, and the company says he had “a front row seat to Apple’s development of its cutting-edge health sensor technology, including highly confidential roadmaps, design and development documents, and specifications for ECG sensor technology.”\nHe now heads up a team working on sensing technology at Oppo — which Apple says it learned because of “messages he left on his Apple-issued work iPhone.” In his resignation letter to Apple, Shi said he was leaving “due to personal and family reasons.” Via that iPhone, Apple also says it found messages from Oppo demonstrating that it “encouraged, approved, and agreed to Dr. Shi’s plan to collect Apple’s proprietary information before leaving Apple.”\n“We are aware of the recent lawsuit filed by Apple in California and have carefully reviewed the allegations in Apple’s complaint. We have found no evidence establishing any connection between these allegations and the employee’s conduct during his employment at Oppo,” said spokesperson Frank Fan, head of Oppo’s Regional Legal Affairs team. ”Oppo respects the trade secrets of all companies, including Apple, and Oppo has not misappropriated Apple’s trade secrets. Oppo will actively cooperate with the legal process, and we are confident that fair judicial proceedings will clarify the facts.“\n\n\nUpdate, August 25th: Added statement from Oppo.",

      "raw": "Trump revealed the news during a briefing about the World Cup. | Photographer: Annabelle Gordon/UPI/Bloomberg via Getty Image\t\n\nThe US is investing $8.9 billion into Intel, but most of the funds come from money that the government was supposed to pay the embattled chipmaker anyway. In an announcement on Friday, Intel said the federal government will fund its investment using the remaining $5.7 billion in grants it hasn’t yet received under the Biden administration’s CHIPS Act, in addition to the $3.2 billion received as part of the Secure Enclave program.\nPresident Donald Trump confirmed the investment during a press briefing before the formal announcement, saying Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan agreed to give the government a 10 percent stake. Earlier this month, Trump called on Tan to resign over his ties to China, and today he positioned the deal as a way for the executive to “keep his job.”\nTrump told reporters that he floated the offer during negotiations with Tan. “I said, ‘I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,’” Trump said. “They’ve agreed to do it, and I think it’s a great deal for them.” Intel has already received $2.2 billion under the CHIPS Act.\nThe government’s investment in Intel “will be a passive ownership, with no Board representation or other governance or information rights,” according to Intel. “We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,” Tan says in the press release.\nThe confirmation of the deal comes just days after SoftBank announced plans to invest $2 billion into Intel to “further expand” chipmaking in the US. \nThe federal government’s stake in the embattled chipmaker marks yet another move that blurs the line between government and business, as reports suggest that the Trump administration has demanded that Nvidia and AMD give the government a 15 percent cut of chip sales to China.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at the government’s potential investment this week, saying during an interview with CNBC that it “would be a conversion of grants” meant to “stabilize the company for chip production here in the US.”\nIt doesn’t seem like this is the end for Trump’s approach to deal-making, as he said during the briefing that “he’ll do more of them” in the future.\nUpdate, August 22nd: Added information from Intel.",
