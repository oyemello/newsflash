      "raw": "All the fawning by tech CEOs wasn’t enough to convince Donald Trump to back off his crusade against immigrants. Yesterday the president announced that the government would be adding a $100,000-a-year fee on all H-1B visas in an effort to discourage their use. \nWhile many industries make significant use of the H-1B program to attract highly skilled foreign workers, the tech industry is particularly reliant. Amazon has roughly 14,000 H-1B workers across its multiple entities, far more than any other company according to data from the federal government. But Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and Tata Consultancy (a major IT services firm) each have more than 4,000 employees working on H-1B visas. \nThe fee will only apply to new applicants and it’s likely to face legal challenges, but even just the specter of this change appears to have some companies scrambling. There are reports that Microsoft issued an internal memo advising any workers currently abroad that operate on a visa to return to the US before the new fees kick in at midnight tonight. And tech companies have already been warning those working on visas not to leave the US for fear that they might not be able to return.\nBroadly when the White House talks about attracting the “top, top people” to the US, it seems they’re talking about wealth not skill. It also unveiled a so-called “gold card” program that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will replace the existing EB-1 and EB-2 visa programs. Those programs are for people of “extraordinary ability” (often artists, athletes, educators, and executives) or those with advanced degrees in competitive fields. The replacement program demands that applicants “prove [their] exceptional value to the United States of America by contributing a million dollars.”\nUnder the gold card potential immigrants would pay $1,000,000 as part of a fast-tracked application process, and that fee could climb to $2,000,000 if the person was sponsored by a company for employment. Clearly this new program would favor wealth over actual skills, though the Trump administration claims (without any data to back it up) that it will raise over $100 billion that it will use to pay down the debt and lower taxes. \nOf course, with the national debt currently exceeding $37 trillion, and the federal government expected to add more than $2 trillion in 2025, any revenue raised by the gold card program or fees on H-1B visas would be insignificant.",

      "raw": "A three-month Kindle Unlimited subscription is free for Amazon Prime members right now.\t\n\nA cool new perk recently became available for Prime members: for a limited time, you can get a three-month subscription to Kindle Unlimited. If your ebookshelf is looking bare, Amazon is currently offering a three-month subscription to Kindle Unlimited for free. The service typically costs $11.99 per month, so the deal saves you $35.97 over the course of the trial. Keep in mind that your subscription will automatically renew once the trial period is over. The discount is one of Amazon’s early Prime Big Deal Days deals (that’s a mouthful), dropping well ahead of the October 7th event. We’ll be on the hunt for more early deals as that date approaches.\nKindle Unlimited is a subscription service that gives you access to a library of over four million books, thousands of audiobooks, and an assortment of magazines. You can download items from the Kindle Unlimited library onto — you guessed it — a Kindle, or any device with the Kindle app. The library is large enough that you should be able to find books in your favorite genres (perhaps by your favorite author, too) and three months is plenty of time to tear through a full series or two. \nYou can browse the Kindle Unlimited library before subscribing to see if there’s any books you’re interested in. It has some must-reads, like The Canterbury Tales and the entire The Expanse series. If you’re reading on a device with a color screen, you can use Kindle Unlimited to read manga and comics, like Watchmen, The Batman Who Laughs, and Doomsday Clock: The Complete Collection, and get the full experience.  \nMore deals our readers loved this week\nThe entire iPhone 17 lineup (plus the iPhone Air) has been released, and we highly recommend getting a screen protector for your new phone.

The tablet has a 10.1-inch 1080p display, 32GB of storage (you can pop in a microSD card for more space), and a battery that Amazon says lasts up to 13 hours. It’s also compatible with Amazon’s Stylus Pen and Bluetooth Keyboard Case, which are helpful if you want to use the tablet for sketching or long-form writing. The tablet has lockscreen ads, which won’t interrupt you when you’re using it, but you can pick up a model without advertisements on sale for $104.99 ($50 off) at Amazon.\nIf you have a speedy internet connection, Nvidia’s GeForce Now lets you play PC games you own through an app — no expensive gaming rig required.

It lasts up to 10 hours per charge, and its M3 processor is powerful enough to play games and run creative apps like Final Cut or DaVinci Resolve. It’s also a great choice if all you want is a nice screen for binging TV shows and movies on the couch, or in bed. If you need an even larger screen, the 128GB 13-inch M3 iPad Air is also on sale for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.

      "raw": "A 10 percent stake in Intel, 15 percent of Nvidia’s China sales, a “golden share” of Nippon Steel — what price will Trump extract next in exchange for favorable treatment? Well, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Trump Administration is “expected to collect a multibillion-dollar fee” in exchange for negotiating a US takeover of TikTok’s US business.\nThat fee will reportedly come from TikTok’s US investors, including private equity firm Silver Lake and Oracle, with the new group getting half of TikTok, while TikTok China’s parent company ByteDance would still have under 20 percent.\nYesterday, Trump said that “the United States is getting a tremendous fee-plus, I call it a ‘fee-plus,’ just for making the deal.” But Trump says a lot of things that need dissecting, and it was absolutely unclear today whether there’s even a TikTok deal or not.  \nSo to see the WSJ reporting that “people familiar with the matter” think a deal might not only get approved, but also see billions of dollars flow from US companies into the Trump Administration’s coffers, sounds like something to be aware of.  Why would those companies pay Trump’s government billions unless they think they’ll make even more?",
