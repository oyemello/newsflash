      "raw": "Garmins aren’t just multisport behemoths anymore. | Illustration by Will Joel / The Verge\t\n\nFew brands are as synonymous with outdoor sports as Garmin. You’ll find these fitness trackers and smartwatches on dozens of wrists at any 5K, marathon, or Ironman. You’ll also find Garmin devotees among divers, thru-hikers, golfers, kiteboarders — you name it. But these devices aren’t just for athletes. The company’s made significant strides in its lifestyle offerings, so regardless of your fitness level, there’s a Garmin for everyone.\nIf you’re coming from a more traditional smartwatch, Garmin’s core strengths lie in fitness, GPS, adventuring, and durability. These are hardy devices that are meant to withstand the elements and last weeks on a single charge. Several models come with offline maps, advanced navigational features, and more training metrics than any other platform. Garmin devices tend to be on the pricier side, and the company announced in March that it would begin putting its newest features behind a paywall. That’s a bummer given Garmin spent years publicly stating it had no intention of charging its users extra.\nGarmins aren’t too shabby on smarts, either. While more fitness-focused than anything from Apple, Google, or Samsung, there’s enough to get you the basics like notifications and then some. For example, most Garmins have fall detection and safety features, and several Garmins released since 2023 have an FDA-cleared EKG feature. (You’ll need a phone on hand, however, as only one Garmin model has cellular connectivity.) Many Garmin devices also support offline music playback and come with a small third-party app ecosystem.\nThere are a lot of Garmin watches to choose from. No, seriously, there are six major lineups, and each has a multitude of models. But no worries — I test several Garmins every year and can help point you in the right direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Garmin for runners\nThe best Garmin for endurance sports\nThe best Garmin on a budget\nThe best Garmin to replace a Fitbit\nThe best Garmin smartwatch\n\nThe best Garmin for runners\nGarmin Forerunner 265 / 265S\nGarmin’s midrange Forerunner watch adds a new OLED display, a week’s worth of battery life, and dual-frequency GPS for better accuracy.\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nMore intuitive menu navigation\nMultiband GPS\nLong battery life — even with AOD enabled\nAdds helpful training features\nOh, oh, it’s OLED, you know\n\nIt’s $100 more than the 255\nOLED displays don’t cost $100\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $449.99 at Amazon\n $449.99 at Best Buy\n $449.99 at Garmin\n\nSizes: 42mm w/ 18mm straps; 46mm w/ 22mm straps / Weight: 39g (42mm); 47g (46mm) / Battery life: Up to 15 days (42mm); 13 days (46mm) in smartwatch mode / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 8GB\nGarmin has many running watches, and a lot of them are great. But the Forerunner 265 or 265S (if you have petite wrists) strikes an excellent balance between price, feature set, battery life, and a vibrant OLED display.\nThat said, the Forerunner 265 / 265S is a bit of an odd duck. It comes a mere nine months after its predecessor, the Forerunner 255, and is, in many ways, pretty much the same watch. The main difference is the 265 has an OLED display compared to the 255’s memory-in-pixel screen. Usually, that means worse battery life, but in this case, we got about a week on a single charge with the always-on display enabled. Without it, you can get up to 15 days. Given that OLED is easier to read and just, well, looks nicer, that gives the 265 lineup an edge over the 255.\nThe 265 also has dual-frequency GPS (also known as multi-band). The gist is you get much more accurate maps in challenging environments like cities and dense forests because you can access both the L1 and L5 satellite frequencies. And even with dual-frequency GPS enabled, you still don’t lose a whole lot of battery life. I wore it during a half marathon with that and the AOD enabled, and I still had over 80 percent battery by the time I got home. This is also an excellent price, as the majority of multi-band GPS watches cost well over $600.\nMy main complaint is that $450 (outside of a deal, at least), while not bad for Garmin, is still a lot when you consider that’s the same price as smarter smartwatches with great running features. Some runners won’t care. But if you’re on a budget — or you’re new to running and feel iffy about spending that much — then consider the Forerunner 165 series. It starts at $249.99 (add another $50 for onboard music) and does almost everything the 265 series does. The main things you’re missing are dual-frequency GPS and a few more niche sport profiles. But if you’re mostly sticking to running, gym equipment, cycling, swimming, and hiking, you’re covered.\nGarmin Forerunner 165 Music\nThe Garmin Forerunner 165 Music gets you in-depth training metrics but leaves out some of the more advanced features in exchange for a more palatable price.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 at Amazon\n $299.99 at Garmin\n $300 at REI\n\nNeither has all of Garmin’s training features, but it’s got what you’ll need to run anything from a 5K to a full marathon. That includes a Race Predictor, which gives you an estimate of what your best time would be based on your actual training. You can also use PacePro to figure out your pacing strategy for a race. You also get Garmin’s Training Readiness feature to help gauge load and recovery, Garmin Coach plans, and a host of running form metrics. It also supports offline music and safety features like fall detection. The only thing they lack is advanced mapping. (They still have trackback, point-to-point navigation, and real-time breadcrumb trail support, however.)\nOn the other hand, if your budget allows, you could also consider the Forerunner 570 and  Forerunner 970, which were released in June and cost $549.99 and $749.99 respectively. Both models have a built-in speaker and microphone, OLED screen, skin temperature sensors, flashlight, and built-in EKG reader with atrial fibrillation detection. They also give you a daily evening report with suggestions on how much sleep you should get, plus a digest of your upcoming events, workouts, and the weather. You also get access to Garmin Coach, a free multipart workout program, which allows you to upload your course and receive notifications when you’ve hit certain distance benchmarks. \nWhile both smartwatches have a lot in common, they do have some key differences, the main being that the 970 has maps. The Forerunner 570 comes in 42mm and 47mm sizes, and Garmin says its battery lasts up to 10 or 11 days based on which model you pick  (with the always-on display off.) The Forerunner 970 only comes in a 47mm size, and Garmin says it can last up to 15 days per charge. The Forerunner 970 also includes three exclusive metrics: running tolerance, running economy, and speed step loss. \nThese three tools will give you a weekly maximum mileage recommendation (with the option to adjust it up or down), and assess running efficiency. The running economy and step speed loss features require Garmin’s $169.99 HRM 600 heart rate monitor.\nThe Forerunner 570 is a definite step up from the Forerunner 265, but not a big enough leap to recommend it to everyone instead of that model, especially because it doesn’t offer offline maps. The Forerunner 970 may be overkill for all but the most avid runners, but it’s good to see Garmin continually adding new features to the top of its line. \nRead my full Garmin Forerunner 265S review.\nThe best Garmin for endurance sports\nGarmin Epix Pro Sapphire Edition (42mm)\nThe Garmin Epix Pro comes in three sizes, includes a handy flashlight, and has multiband GPS. Plus, it lasts over a week on a single charge.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nNow comes in multiple sizes\nHands-free flashlight is SO handy\nGreat battery life\nMultiband GPS\nUpgraded heart rate sensor\nStarting price hasn’t changed\n\nAOD zaps battery life to three to four days\nLots of incremental changes\nIt’s a Garmin review, so once again, the app\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999.99 $869.94 at Amazon\n $999.99 at Garmin\n $1000 at REI\n\nSizes: 42mm w/ 20mm straps; 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 51mm w/ 26mm straps / Weight: 42mm: 63g stainless steel, 58g titanium; 47mm: 78g stainless steel, 70g titanium; 51mm: 98g stainless steel, 88g titanium / Battery life: 42mm: up to 10 days (4 with AOD); 47mm: up to 16 days (6 with AOD); 51mm: up to 31 days (11 with AOD) / Display type: OLED / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 10ATM / Music storage: Up to 32GB\nThe Epix Pro will get you most fitness features that Garmin has to offer. You have topographical maps, turn-by-turn navigation, and more training metrics than even a seasoned triathlete would know what to do with.\nThe Pro is more size-inclusive than the standard second-gen Epix, which only comes in 47mm. You can get the Pro in that size, too, but it also comes in 42mm and 51mm. This was a major complaint I had with the second-gen Epix, and you love to see companies actually take this sort of thing seriously. The best part is that the Pro models start at the same price as the regular Epix did. You’ll have to pay $100 extra for materials like titanium and sapphire crystal, but that’s also true of the standard Epix.\nGarmin Fenix 8\nThe Garmin Fenix 8 adds smart features like the ability to take calls on the wrist, and an on-board voice assistant. Read our review.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmartens up Garmin’s flagship multisport watch\nExcellent battery and fitness tracking\nOffers MIP and OLED display options\nCondenses the Fenix and Epix lines into one\n\nThe starting price is $350 more than the Fenix 7!\nSmart features are less helpful without LTE\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999.99 at Garmin\n $1000 at REI\n\nThat said, it muddies the waters if you’re trying to pick between the Epix Pro, Fenix 7, Fenix 7 Pro, and now, the Fenix 8. The main difference is the Epix watches all have OLED displays. One reason I prefer OLED is that they’re much easier to read indoors — where most of us spend the majority of our time. The Fenix 7 series’ memory-in-pixel displays (plus solar charging if you opt for it) allow for weeks and weeks of charge, but the smallest Epix Pro can get around 10 days with normal usage. The 47mm and 51mm Pro models can go longer between charges due to bigger batteries, but I felt that the 42mm has enough juice to satisfy most use cases. Garmin also has so many battery-saving modes and options that I highly doubt this will ever be an issue.\nNot helping matters is the fact that the Fenix 8 lets you choose between an OLED or a MIP display. You also get smart features like an onboard voice assistant, the ability to take calls from the wrist, and the Garmin Messenger app. The main problem is the starting price is now $350 more (barring any deals) than the standard Fenix 7 and right about on par with the Epix Pro. My personal feeling is the Fenix 8’s smart features are just okay and that you’re really not missing much by not having them. We also often see discounts on older models, so I would put on my bargain-hunting hat for a discounted Epix Pro or Fenix 7 Pro while inventory is still available.\nBut really, the winning feature of the Epix Pro is the hands-free flashlight. It’s so useful in my day-to-day life, and all you have to do is double-press a button. It’s as bright as your smartphone, comes with a red light option if you want something easier on the eyes, and can act as a strobe in an emergency situation. The Fenix 7 Pro and 8 watches also have a flashlight, so a lot of this is going to come down to personal preference for the display, price, and whether you care about smart features.\nGarmin Fenix 7S Pro\nLike the Garmin Epix Pro, the Fenix 7 Pro line has an updated optical heart rate sensor for improved accuracy. It also has excellent battery life, a slightly brighter MIP display, solar charging, and the option of upgrading to sapphire crystal.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHands-free flashlight\nLong battery life\nMultiband GPS\nUpgraded heart rate monitor\n\nThe improved MIP display is still not the easiest to read in dim lighting\nToo similar to the standard Fenix 7\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $899.99 $789.51 at Amazon\n $899.99 at Best Buy\n $899.99 at Garmin\n\nIf you’re set on the most battery life possible, I recommend the Fenix 7 Pro over the standard 7 for a few reasons. Its MIP display is slightly brighter, all sizes have the flashlight, and, like the Epix Pro, it has an updated sensor array. I also recommend it over the MIP versions of the Fenix 8 because it comes in more sizes, and costs around $300 less. Especially since the Fenix 8’s smart features are a bit half-baked.\nRead my full Epix Pro review.\nThe best Garmin on a budget\nGarmin Vivomove Sport\nGarmin’s entry-level hybrid smartwatch looks like a Swatch at first glance. However, it sports a hidden OLED display that delivers notifications without sacrificing fitness tracking.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAesthetically pleasing and accurate tracking\nGood for smaller wrists\nAffordable price\nThe hidden OLED is cool\n\nThe Garmin app is overly complicated\nBattery life is shorter than other hybrids\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 at Garmin\n $179.99 at Amazon\n\nSizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 19g / Battery life: Up to 5 days / Display type: “Hidden” OLED touchscreen / GPS: Tethered GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A\nWhat I love most about the Vivomove Sport is that it doesn’t look like what most people expect from a Garmin. It’s a hybrid smartwatch, which means it looks like a regular watch but can track fitness and deliver notifications. Garmin’s hybrids are also unique in that they all use an OLED display that stays hidden until you need it.\nThis is best suited for a casually active person who wants style and value in a lightweight package. Think wellness, more so than fitness. It gets you continuous heart rate monitoring and blood oxygen level monitoring, and can even provide abnormal heart rate alerts. You also get access to more in-depth metrics like respiration rate, fitness age, stress, and Body Battery, which is Garmin’s tool for visualizing how well-rested you are. For smart features, you get all the basics, like notifications, alarms, and timers.\nThe Sport isn’t quite as full-featured as some other Garmin watches you’ll find on this list. For instance, you’re giving up built-in GPS in favor of tethered GPS through your phone. There are no contactless payments, nor is there a microphone or speaker for taking calls on the wrist. But this is a budget pick, and you get a lot, considering this is an entry-level gadget that could pass for a Swatch at a glance.\nI don’t love that the battery life is short for a hybrid, at around three to four days. Even so, that’s still much better than what you’ll get on an Apple Watch or Wear OS 4 watch. If you’re willing to spend about $100 more, the $269.99 Vivomove Trend has more chic materials, gets you more screen real estate, and wireless Qi charging. Otherwise, this is a great lifestyle wearable that can serve as a classier alternative to your typical fitness band.\nGarmin Lily 2\nThe Garmin Lily 2 is a simple yet chic hybrid analog smartwatch that delivers basic fitness tracking, notifications, and up to five days of battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $248.98 at Amazon\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n $249.99 at Garmin\n\nIf you prefer something newer to the Sport that’s also stylish, the Garmin Lily 2 is another good option, especially if you’ve got particularly small wrists or prefer something extremely lightweight. The swipe and tap gestures are still a little fiddly to use — which was also the case with the first-gen model — but the fresh design is a fun way to lightly monitor your fitness without bogging yourself down with notifications. Garmin also offers the Lily 2 Active, which adds a physical button, GPS, and support for more sports tracking for a starting price of $299.99.\nRead my full Garmin Vivomove Sport review.\nThe best Garmin to replace a Fitbit\nGarmin Venu Sq 2\nThe Garmin Venu Sq 2 is a great replacement for a Fitbit smartwatch. Not only do they look similar, but the Venu Sq 2 has way more fitness features, long battery life, and no subscription.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBright display\nLong battery life\nTons of training and health features\n\nCluttered app\nProprietary USB-A charger\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $189.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $199 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Garmin\n\nSizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 38g / Battery life: Up to 11 days / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 4GB (for Music Edition)\nIf you were disappointed by the Fitbit Sense 2 and Versa 4, the Venu Sq 2 is the next best thing (and, in some ways, better).\nAt a glance, the Venu Sq 2 could easily be mistaken for an Apple Watch. On the wrist, you’ll notice it’s made of plastic, but it still looks quite chic and extremely lightweight. The screen is bright, easy to read, and looks better than any Versa or Sense ever did.\nThe feature set is also great for the price, with built-in GPS, a ton of watch faces, emergency safety features, and contactless payments. If you pay $50 more for the Music Edition, you’ll also get about 500 songs worth of storage, but we wouldn’t recommend it. This doesn’t have cellular connectivity and, therefore, isn’t truly standalone. You’ll most likely be carrying your phone with you anyway.\nAs for health features, the Venu Sq 2 basically has everything you’d get on a Versa or Sense smartwatch but with Garmin’s treasure trove of metrics as well. That includes heart rate tracking, blood oxygen tracking, intensity minutes (how much moderate exercise you get in a week), stress tracking, hydration tracking, respiratory rate, period tracking, and Garmin’s recovery feature, Body Battery. As far as fitness goes, you also get access to Garmin Coach, which provides free 5K, 10K, and half marathon training plans. You love to see it.\nAnother big leg-up Garmin has over Fitbit? None of these features or metrics are locked behind a paywall, even if Garmin’s AI-powered insights and a few other expanded features will only be available as part of Garmin Connect Plus ($6.99 a month / $69.99 annually).\nRead my full Garmin Venu Sq 2 review.\nThe best Garmin smartwatch\nGarmin Venu 3S\nThe Garmin Venu 3S adds a new heart rate sensor, a wheelchair mode, and much-improved sleep tracking and nap detection. \n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood battery life\nBetter sleep tracking and nap detection\nEKG and AFib features\nCan take calls and use your phone’s voice assistant\nAudio meditation sessions done well\n\nPricey compared to other lifestyle smartwatches\nLimited third-party app ecosystem\nNo LTE capability\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $449.99 at Amazon\n $449.99 at Best Buy\n $449.99 at Walmart\n\nSizes: 41mm w/ 18mm straps; 45mm w/ 22mm straps / Weight: 40g for the 3S; 47g for the 3 / Battery life: Up to 10 days for 3S; 14 days for 3 / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 8GB\nGarmin has shored up the smarts in its watches over the past several years, and the Venu 3 series is the smartest (and most affordable) of the bunch.\nThe Venu 3 series comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Like the Venu 2 Plus, it has a microphone and speaker. You can take calls directly from the wrist and issue commands to your phone’s digital assistant via Bluetooth. It’s not the same as having Siri, Bixby, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant built directly into the watch, but it’s a clever workaround that works well for hands-free control. It also supports safety features like fall detection and live tracking, as well as contactless payments.\nLike other OLED Garmins, the display is both vibrant and easy to read. As for health and fitness, you get a nice mix of basic and more advanced features and metrics. It has Garmin’s latest heart rate sensor, which enables FDA-cleared EKG and AFib detection features. Overall, it leans a bit more on the wellness and health side of things, with intensity minutes, blood oxygen monitoring, sleep tracking, period tracking, abnormal heart rate alerts, and stress tracking. As for training, you still get built-in GPS, VO2 Max, heart rate zones, respiration rate, and downloadable training plans via Garmin Coach.\nNew to the 3 and 3S is a sleep coach that factors in metrics like heart rate variability and recent activity to determine your sleep needs. It also finally adds nap detection, a feature that’s been long overdue for the Garmin platform. The Venu 3 series also adds audio-guided meditation sessions, and you can view how these sessions directly impact your metrics. From an accessibility standpoint, this also adds a wheelchair mode.\nTechnically, the Fenix 8 is slightly smarter in that it adds an on-board voice assistant. However, it is also more than double the price and not what I’d consider a good value for the average athlete. It’s more for people who spend hours upon hours training every week.\nThis is the Garmin for you if you want the platform’s in-depth training without sacrificing the productivity of a smartwatch. The main things it’s lacking are cellular options and a robust third-party app ecosystem. That said, it’s got Spotify, Amazon Music, and Deezer for offline listening. It’s also a good option if you’re fed up with MIP displays and want a smarter Garmin rather than a full-on smartwatch.\nRead my full Garmin Venu 3S review.\nUpdate, August 18th: Adjusted pricing / availability.",

      "raw": "Older Nest thermostat users can finally uninstall the older dedicated Nest app. | Image: Google\t\n\nGoogle has announced that users of the US and UK versions of the 3rd gen Nest Learning Thermostat and the Nest Thermostat E can now schedule temperature adjustments using the Google Home app. Newer versions of the Nest thermostats already allow you to manually set schedules in the Home app, but those older models required users to keep the dedicated Nest app installed for scheduling.\nGoogle says the feature “began rolling out starting last week” so it may not yet be available to all Nest thermostat users yet. The company originally announced the expanded Google Home support for the older Nest models last April after revealing that it would also end software updates for the first-generation Nest Learning thermostat that launched in 2011, and the second generation model that was released a year later.\nExisting temperature schedules in the Nest app are transferred over to the Home app, which also allows sensor and fan schedules to be set. Today Google also announced other improvements to its Home app for all Nest thermostats including more vibrant colors and updated descriptions making it easier to see the device’s heating and cooling state, and a refreshed energy dashboard with more details and a weekly comparison of year-over-year energy usage.",

      "raw": "Two years ago we learned, thanks to the FTC, that Microsoft was working on a separate “dedicated” version of Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft Gaming CFO Tim Stuart then hinted, a few months later, that there could be a free version Xbox Cloud Gaming in exchange for ads. Now, Microsoft is hinting at making Xbox Cloud Gaming “more affordable” again.\n Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of Next Generation, has appeared on the company’s official Xbox podcast today, to discuss Xbox Cloud Gaming, Xbox Play Anywhere, and Microsoft’s next-gen chip partnership with AMD. At the moment Xbox Cloud Gaming is only part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, meaning you have to pay $19.99 a month to get access to xCloud.\n“One of the things we see is there’s a lot of players who use Game Pass Ultimate to access the cloud, whether that’s the primary way they play, or an additional way to play on the go,” says Ronald. “I think for us, it really opens up the opportunity to make it much more affordable, and make it more accessible to players. Whether that’s going into new regions, or new ways to actually access the [Xbox] cloud.”\n\nMicrosoft’s hints of a more affordable version of Xbox Cloud Gaming come just hours before Nvidia has some “major” GeForce Now news. Nvidia’s cloud gaming service is far superior to Xbox Cloud Gaming, thanks to PC-powered performance, better bitrates, higher resolution gameplay, and lower latency. Microsoft has even integrated GeForce Now into its own Xbox game pages.\nRonald stops short of announcing a new Xbox Cloud Gaming tier, but it’s clear that’s been Microsoft’s thinking for a few years now. Microsoft started expanding Xbox Cloud Gaming beyond just the Game Pass library last year, with the ability to stream games you own as long as you’re an Ultimate subscriber. \nThere’s an opportunity to bring that Ultimate paywall down, especially for mobile streaming. Microsoft had planned to sell games directly in its Xbox app for Android and allow customers to immediately stream those games directly to their phones and tablets, but a legal battle has put those plans on hold.\nMicrosoft is currently preparing the next generation of Xbox Cloud Gaming, alongside its next-gen Xbox console work. “Together with AMD, we’re designing dedicated silicon and hardware to enable the next generation of gaming experiences,” says Ronald. “We’re investing deeply in the next generation of rendering technologies, such as neural rendering, which will bring a new level of quality to the games that you’re having.”\nThat next generation of Xbox hardware will likely see Xbox and Windows move even closer together, alongside the choice of different stores for Xbox owners. It’s also an opportunity for Microsoft to bring more AI-powered features to the next Xbox. \n“We’re also investing in dedicated silicon to enable the next generation of AI capabilities, that will be transformative in how you actually experience your gameplay,” says Ronald. Microsoft will “start experimenting” with some of these AI-powered features on the upcoming Xbox Ally X device, because it has a dedicated NPU chip just like Microsoft’s Copilot Plus PCs.",

Developers will have to verify that they are 17 years or older if they want to make an experience for users in that same age group.",

      "raw": "Welcome to Decoder! This is Casey Newton, founder and editor of Platformer and cohost of the Hard Fork podcast. I’ve had a lot of fun guest-hosting a few episodes of Decoder while Nilay is out on parental leave this summer. If you listened to the last couple of Monday shows, you know I’ve been doing a series with founders who are focused on productivity.\nThis is my third and, sadly, last time joining the show during the break, but I’m very excited about this episode. Today I’m talking with Steph Ango, who is the CEO of Obsidian.\nObsidian is a note-taking and productivity app that fits into a similar “second brain” space to Notion, the CEO of which I interviewed here on Decoder last week. But Obsidian differentiates itself with a really unusual approach to its business. It still wants to be your entire personal knowledge base — to hold all your notes, links, files, and other information — but it works in a very different way.\n\n\n\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!\nIn Obsidian, files are Markdown-based, stored locally on your own devices, and completely free to use. You’ll hear Steph say that he doesn’t even know how many users Obsidian has or how sticky the software is, which is more or less unheard of among startups I cover.\nObsidian does charge a subscription fee for access to certain features, including cross-device sync, version history, and web publishing. But it’s still a model that feels decidedly old-fashioned for software that’s trying to keep up with the current world, and so I had to ask him about those decisions. \nSteph’s role as CEO is also unusual, because although Obsidian is still a very young, very small, and very flat organization, he’s actually not one of the founders. He joined in 2023, when cofounders Shida Li and Erica Xu brought him in based on his experience with his former startup, Lumi. He was also a huge Obsidian fan.\nSo I really wanted to ask him about that, too, because I suspected his answers to the big Decoder questions about organization and decision-making were going to be pretty unusual for a Decoder guest. \nAnd in one interesting twist, I asked Steph why, when so many of his competitors seem to be racing to stuff their productivity products with AI features, it didn’t seem like Obsidian was all too eager to follow suit. His answer, I thought, was pretty illuminating. \nOkay, Obsidian CEO Steph Ango. Here we go.\n\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nSteph Ango, you are the CEO of Obsidian. Welcome to Decoder.\nThanks, Casey. I’m glad to be here.\nWhat is Obsidian? How does it work and who is it for?\nIf you really want to boil it down, Obsidian is a note-taking app. A lot of people use it for writing their thoughts down, journaling. A lot of people are students who like to track their progress through school, or do their research notes. There are authors, book writers, big fans of RPGs who love to use it. What makes Obsidian unique is that it sort of works like Wikipedia, in that the core unit is a link between your notes. So, if I was to write about my experience today in my journal, I’d say, “I was on the Decoder podcast with Casey,” and each time I mentioned something I might form a link out of “Decoder.”\nIt’s okay if that link is not pointing to anything yet, but later down the road, I might create a note for Decoder because I want to track some of the interesting interviews I’ve listened to on that podcast. So over time, your web of knowledge becomes greater and you have more nodes in your Obsidian. Fundamentally, when you open the app, it works a lot like Apple Notes, Evernote, Notion, or any other similar kind of app out there.\nWhen you joined the company in 2023, you said, “I can’t overstate how life-changing Obsidian has been for me. It has fundamentally improved the way I think. I want to see what happens if more people gain that superpower.” What do you feel like is the superpower that Obsidian gave you, and why did no other products make you feel quite the same way?\nI’ve been writing notes and journaling for over 20 years, and I’ve used a lot of different apps. This idea of thinking about the world like your own personal Wikipedia was really powerful. I had kind of kludged together a few different apps to make something that kind of worked that way.  A lot of Wiki-based software already existed, but most of it was designed around publishing a full Wiki to the web as opposed to using it for your own personal notes.\nWhen it came out, the founders of Obsidian, Shida [Li] and Erica [Xu], had already put in the level of polish that was not there in the glued together prototype that I had. It was instantly something that made sense to me. It made sense also because the data is stored is in this very durable format that people can own, which is called Markdown. You get super fans of Markdown and… for people who’ve never heard of it before in the audience. I’m not sure who —\nI think we probably have a lot of Markdown users in the Decoder audience, but for those who have maybe not seen it yet, how would you describe it?\nBasically, the oldest file types we have, going back to the 1960s, are plain text files. Markdown takes the idea of a plain text file, which is just raw text, and allows you to add basic formatting. So, if you want some text to be bold, a heading, a table, or a list, it allows you to use simple characters like punctuation marks to indicate what’s going to be bold or italic, for example. \nThe power here is that the data is stored in this very simple format. So, we have this view around your data that you can hold your data for a long time and you, or your kids’ kids, your legacy, whatever it is, will be able to read it 100 years from now. Maybe none of the notes matter at all, or maybe they’ll be curious. But what if that data could be preserved over the long term? We think that going back to some of the simplest formats that exist and giving you that control over your data is more likely to persist over time. So, that’s one of our philosophies.\nGoing back to your question, I was really excited about the principles coming together. To the point of how it made me think differently, I think once you have this concept of links and ideas that can be networked together, you can start to form more complicated, complex, or interesting thoughts than you otherwise could. I don’t know about other people, but I can only have two or three different ideas in my mind at once. But if you can start to create these little building blocks of ideas, you can combine them in interesting ways. Your ideas become these little Lego blocks that you can interchange and mix together, so you can start forming some interesting and complicated thoughts.\nI would love to hear an example of when you felt like you were able to do that in Obsidian. You’ve written online about your note-taking practice. You described it for us a minute ago, talking about how you keep a daily journal and as new characters and ideas come in, you’ll link them and build them up over time. I’m curious about that next step. Is there a time when all of that added up to let you make something you maybe wouldn’t have otherwise?\nWell, there are the projects I’m interested in. Even though I’m the CEO of Obsidian, I see it as a means to an end. I like to write, so I write a lot of short essays on my blog. A lot of the essays came from marinating in Obsidian, where I can debate with myself whether an idea is good or not. I have this essay called “Pain Is Information.” I was going through a pretty tough time a few years back, and I read this book by [Haruki] Murakami, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running. It’s this autobiographical story about running, and I came across this quote… I’m trying to remember it on the fly, but it’s something like, “When you sign up for a marathon, you know that you’re signing up for pain.” “Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional.”\nThat idea was really interesting to me because I was going through a painful time. I was thinking about how touching your hand to a stove gives you a signal that [doing] that’s a bad idea, but that’s information. So, I was starting to think about information, pain, and the relationship between those things. You can see how these ideas are forming out of thin air, out of different inspirations that I’m going through. And what I like about Obsidian is it gives you this place to approach it in a very freeform way and connect different concepts you might be thinking about. \nFor me it’s in this philosophical realm, but for other people it might be with biology or language learning. My partner speaks Chinese, and I’ve been wanting to learn Chinese, so I’m starting to bring together these different ideas. I’m into woodworking and I’m always learning new skills, new details, or new tools that I might want to use, and I’m doing research about that. All of those things can coexist inside of this digital place, which is kind of weird because you could have a connection between a woodworking tool, a city I went to in China, and the concept Murakami was describing, all those things are just ingredients in this soup, and you could start to come up with ideas that you just wouldn’t have thought of otherwise. Maybe that’s enlightening.\nSomething that a lot of people value about Obsidian and similar apps is that they can be engines for serendipity. You gather strings in the manner you just described, and then in the process of clicking back through your notes or using other tools inside the app, you revisit ideas and they spark new ones or you see connections that you might not have otherwise.\nDefinitely. I think that one of the benefits of this approach is that it’s quite freeform. What I’ve run into with other tools or other approaches, like a physical journal, is that you’re quite constrained by the fact that it’s just pieces of paper you flip through. It has the limitation of being a 2D surface. Or, a lot of apps use folders or tags, whereas here you don’t have to know what something is going to be about until later when the connections form. And you’re free to have 700 tabs open inside of Obsidian and be doing this crazy, It’s Always Sunny mind mapping with the red thread everywhere. It allows you to do that where something with a more top-down hierarchy would make it more difficult.\nYou’re not a co-founder of Obsidian. You were brought in as CEO in 2023. How did that come about, and what were you brought in to do?\nThe app came out in 2020, and I found out about it with the first version. It was right at the beginning of the pandemic, and I think all of us were going stir-crazy. There was this moment in time where a lot of interesting tools popped up because everybody was like, “What am I going to do with all this extra free time where I’m hanging out at home?” So, I started using it right away for the reasons I described before. It made sense, and Obsidian is super customizable, so you can make plugins, you can make themes, and you can modify it in really significant or small ways. I was just starting to put all these community things out there. I was running a different startup at the time, and I was just putting these things out there because I was making them for myself and people started using them.\nShida and Erica are amazing engineers who met at the University of Waterloo. They’re geniuses in terms of engineering and community management. What I was bringing to the table as a community member was a sense of design and product that they had a little less of. Because the Obsidian community is so strong, some of the things I was making were getting a lot of adoption, and I was collaborating with other people in the community. They found out about that and wanted to put a quote from me on their front page. \nSo, we started chatting, and then we started talking about business. They started telling me about the business model and some of the challenges that they were dealing with. We just kept talking for a couple years, and I was using Obsidian all the time. It was just the main app that I had. When I sold my previous startup, Lumi, I started to think what would be my next thing. I was thinking about building something else or starting a new company, and I just was spending all my time in Obsidian using the app, and I realized I was having so much fun using this tool. \nSo, I pitched to them, “What if I could come on board and help you guys?” At first, it took the shape of contract work, working with them as an advisor and working on the 1.0 release that had this new design that I built. Shida is an incredible engineer, one of the best I’ve ever worked with, and eventually, he just wanted to focus on that. It created this nice balance. We’re a really small team. We are seven full-time people, so there’s something nice about the balance of the different strengths we all have. Everyone can kind of do everything, but at the same time, each person has their core strengths. \nFor me, it’s around design, consolidating the true essence of Obsidian and trying to communicate it out to the world. Then, because we’re only seven people, there are a lot of hats to be worn, whether it’s accounting, legal, all these are random things. Also, I had a lot of experience running startups, so I think that was helpful.\nYou mentioned the plugin ecosystem. It seems to me that plugins have been one of the main ways that Obsidian has grown, both in its feature set and in building features that have attracted new users. What was the origin of plugins and how have they fueled the company’s growth?\nIn a way, plugins are what allow us to stay small because there are so many capabilities that people want that are fairly narrow and will only be useful to 1 percent or less of our user base. You see this all the time with apps that have been around for a long time, where the feature set just keeps growing and growing. Then the app becomes bloated, slow, and hard to use because there’s just too much functionality in there. \nFor new users, it becomes extremely confusing. I think initially, it was this defensive move against having to implement all these features, to basically say, “Here, you go do it.” And because it’s built on web technologies like JavaScript and CSS, a lot of people know how to build things for it because they know those languages. You don’t need to know Swift or be a cross-platform app developer to know how to make a plugin. You can make something really simple in a matter of minutes or hours depending on your level. \nSo, I think the initial reasoning was that this will allow us to not build everything ourselves. But then, the creative things people come up with are always pushing the envelope of what our API should be able to support and how the platform can allow even more flexibility. I mean, out of a few thousand plugins that exist, only a small portion that really make sense to be in the core app. Some of them do end up becoming something we notice, like when 80 percent of the user base is relying on one plugin. \nFor example, right now we’re working on this thing called Bases, which allows you to view your notes in a database-type format, and there are a number of plugins that do something like that in the Obsidian community. So, it’s a signal to us that this is actually really important and should be in the core app.\nWhat are some other plugins that have just been really popular or took the app in unexpected but successful directions?\nSome of the most popular ones are very simple. Somebody who’s on the team today, Tony Grosinger, wrote this plugin called Advanced Tables, which was just a way to simplify making tables in Obsidian. We’re talking about something very basic, but rows and columns were difficult to do earlier on, and if you’re someone who wants to live completely in the Markdown world, they’re kind of tricky to make. We ended up hiring Tony, and he built that functionality alongside another developer who — basically everyone we’ve hired or worked with was once a community plugin author or team developer. That makes it really easy for us to start bringing the right people who are passionate about Obsidian on board. \nThere are plugins about theming, styling, changing fonts and colors. A lot of people enjoy that customizability and want to be able to make this journal space their own. There are a lot of plugins that help you integrate with other services. So, if you want your calendar in there or something like that, you can do that. There are integrations into a million different apps out there. If you want to be doing your tasks and to-do lists in Obsidian, there’s a whole bunch of plugins that help you with that. The cool thing about that is if you’re interested in Obsidian because you want to do world building for your RPG tabletop group, you can do that and you don’t have to have the entire calendar functionality inside of your Obsidian. You can just use the plugins that have to do with that.\nPlugins were really the first thing that brought Obsidian to my attention. I’d been using Roam Research, which I do credit for inventing a lot of the current note-taking paradigm, but Obsidian just developed much faster thanks to plugins. I’m curious what you did to attract those first developers. Was it as simple as having a really good API that was available early on? What was it that the company did?\nI think it’s a combination of things. One, like I mentioned, is that the languages and framework are very simple for anyone to use. Anyone who’s done any kind of web development would pretty much know how to build a plugin, so it’s very accessible to a lot of developers. \nThe values of Obsidian, just as a pure note-taking tool, are very aligned with what developers like. So, a lot of developers use Obsidian as their note-taking app of choice because it’s private and it uses this Markdown format as the core way to write text. Because it’s so customizable, it attracts developers and then developers use it all day long. We have published APIs that pretty much allow you to do anything with the app, and there’s a lot of documentation. So, it’s that combination: a lot of developers are using it, it’s easy to make the plugins, and we added the API very early on. If you have that itch, you can scratch it very quickly. If Obsidian’s not working the way you want, you can change it very fast.\nRecently, I interviewed Ivan Zhao of Notion for Decoder. You mentioned Notion is another product in this space that sometimes people might choose over Obsidian. It strikes me that while your products do some of the same things, they’re designed very differently. Notion is about pixel-perfect polish and beautiful interface elements. Obsidian, by default, can look a bit more like a terminal. You take notes in Markdown, and it has more of this DIY, almost hacker ethos. Is that intentional and do you think it affects the kinds of users you attract?\nI think the fundamental difference between Obsidian and Notion is that Notion is a cloud service. It’s an app that interfaces primarily with software as a service-type cloud service. You have to either be in your browser or on an app, and you connect to a source of truth that’s in the cloud. With Obsidian, all your data is local. So, if you’re not online —  if you’re on a plane or something like that — you always have access to your data. That difference shapes a whole bunch of other things.\nFor example, it would be really hard to add plugins to Notion because it can’t make it easy to run arbitrary code on its cloud-based platform, whereas with Obsidian, it’s pretty easy. So, there’s this fundamental split that occurs because of the architecture. It’s the same with things like theming, design, and how much user interface customizability there is. I don’t know if this will make sense to anyone who’s listening, but when I was 11 or 12 years old, there was Winamp, Winamp 2 was coming out, and I was all about making themes and things for Winamp, which was a music player that you could customize.\nIt really whipped the llama’s ass. I have to say that.\nAbsolutely. I think there’s a bit of that flavor in Obsidian. Obsidian is quite popular with a lot of younger people, and I don’t know what it is. At that time, you have the energy and the desire to have control over your digital space, and Obsidian makes that easy. So in that sense, we’re a bit less prescriptive about what the interface should look like, even though we’re trying to make it a little bit more approachable to still retain infinite depth. It’s like you’re going to the beach: we want to make the shallow waters a little more accessible for people who are coming into it, but then you can swim as far as you like, as deep as you like, into the complexity of Obsidian. Finding the right balance between those two things is quite challenging, and it’s something we’re always working on.\nAs I mentioned, I used Roam, then I used Obsidian, and then I used Mem. Now I use something called Capacities. Obviously I have a huge problem. I’m working on it in therapy. But I’m curious about how sticky Obsidian is. It’s free to get started, but I imagine lots of people abandon their vaults after only creating a few free notes. What makes people leave and what makes people stay?\nWe actually don’t know how many users Obsidian has. We don’t know how sticky it is because we don’t have any analytics. It’s very privacy-oriented, so we don’t track anything about our users. We don’t know what suddenly causes someone to churn or whatever. We prefer not to track those things. Also, the data doesn’t have to be exported. If Obsidian went out of business someday, you would still have the app on your computer. Even if you chose not to use it, you don’t even have to launch the app. You don’t have to export anything. This is one of the big issues people have had with other tools that have either gone out of business or been acquired by private equity firms that start tightening the screws and increasing the pricing over time — you feel like you’re locked in and you can’t do anything about it.\nWith Obsidian, your data is there. I think the feelings of freedom and security are paradoxically quite sticky because even though you have all your data, you could just… Personally, I’m constantly editing my Obsidian files not in Obsidian. I will use code editors and other tools to do mass modifications to hundreds of files. You can run Python scripts on your data. You can kind of do anything because they’re just files at the end of the day.\nJust briefly, every file that is created in Obsidian is a Markdown file that can be opened up in basically any text editor.\nYeah. So it’s not a database in the cloud. It’s not a database on your computer somewhere that other apps can’t access. It’s literally just a bunch of files that you can move and change with any app. So yes, it makes it a lot easier to leave the app, but it also paradoxically gives people comfort that they have that option at any time. \nWe’re not trying to be Notion. Notion has raised hundreds of millions of dollars. I think it’s amazing, especially on the collaboration side. It has a lot of advantages that make the app better for certain things. We’re just a small team. Our focus is to keep making the tool better and stay small, as long as we’re making enough money to stay afloat.\nWe’re not trying to take over the world. We’re not trying to be the next Microsoft. That makes it a lot easier to make long-term decisions that we feel are better for ourselves or for our users. It’s the tool that we want to use all day long. So, it’s okay if people leave. And different people have different brains and different approaches to thinking, so maybe they should leave. Maybe that would be better for them.\nLet me ask you about one challenge I’ve had using tools like this. I wrote a couple of years ago about how I had spent years linking and tagging all my notes, reviewing them on a pretty regular basis, and still not feeling like I was getting a ton of insights from that process. I was worried that these tools can be a substitute for thinking rather than an enhancement because if you spend all day tending to your digital garden, you might not spend as much time just walking down the street and giving your brain the chance to breathe and ideate. Was I just using these tools incorrectly, or do you think that productivity tools can sometimes be counterproductive for people?\nI think they can sometimes be designed with anti-patterns that are explicitly about that. Some companies have metrics that they track, like the number of active users, but how do they define active? So now they’re sending you notifications to remind you to come back to the app so that you do whatever the thing is. That’s part of the reason we’re not interested in having any of this data because we don’t really want to be tracking our users in this way or incentivizing them to create usage where none is needed. If you use Obsidian throughout the day and you have these random ideas you just want to drop inside of your daily note, you should be able to do that and not get sucked into this thing that’s trying to engage you. \nThere are a lot of people who keep trying new apps and nothing sticks for them or they get caught up in the organization and beautification of their notes. I think that can happen in any app. I hear about this, in general, and I don’t know what the cause is. My sense is that it has nothing to do with the apps unless they’re literally trying to engagement-bait you in these weird ways. I think it’s sort of an affliction of the digital age. These things are so malleable that it scratches an itch that we have in our brain to optimize. For certain people who love solving puzzles or doing Sudoku, it’s kind of addictive in a way that might not be the most healthy. \nI’m not exactly sure how to solve that. The way I try to address that, at least in my personal life, is being very aware of how the business of many of these apps works and how they’re trying to capture your attention and time. So, I’m always disabling notifications for everything, trying to spend a lot of time walking in nature, doing woodworking, cooking, and other activities that I find restorative. Then, that makes my Obsidian time feel more rewarding, productive, and useful because — productive is not the right word. I just have things to write about. I have a life that I’m trying to dissect. “Oh, what happened today?” or “What problem am I trying to solve?” And if you don’t have those other things going on, then you don’t have something to write about, and you’re now in the space massaging something. This is probably more of a question for a psychologist to solve, but I do see it, and I don’t know what the answer is necessarily.\nWell, let’s ask the Decoder questions. You’ve mentioned that you have seven full-time employees. How is Obsidian structured? That sounds like a pretty flat structure.\nWe have two people who are working on community related things full time — essentially customer service and plugin review. One of the ways that we scale is that we have very active communities on Discord, Reddit, and elsewhere. There’s a lot of user help, so users help other users, which is nice because it means that we don’t have to have as many customer service people on staff. \nThen, we have three full-time engineers, me, and then Erica, who works on marketing, community, and other things. I suppose I’m the only person who’s a trained designer, so I end up doing a lot of UX design, marketing related things, and our web-facing stuff. But in recent years, I’ve also taken on more. I’ve picked up a lot of engineering skills and have been enjoying collaborating more on the technical side as well.\nIt sounds like you’re giving yourself a lot of tasks. I would be careful of that.\nIt’s okay. I was previously running this startup that had 45 people. It was a very different thing. I was in meetings all day long, every day, 10 hours a day. At Obsidian, we have one meeting per year, so my time is very — \nWow. Goals! You just made a lot of people very jealous right now.\nI think it’s achievable. We use Discord and our Slack equivalent to chat as a team all the time, and we’re in there consistently talking. But in terms of synchronous meetings, it’s quite rare. I think part of it is because everyone’s a user of the app, knows what something Obsidian-y feels like, and we generally only have one or two goals at any given time. So, it makes things quite self-motivated as far as how the team functions.\nGot it.\nWe’ve mentioned that Obsidian is unique in a lot of ways. There’s no signup requirement. You can download and use it for free. You guys don’t even know how many users you have. People can create an unlimited amount of notes. How is that sustainable for you?\nObsidian has a few different revenue sources. One is Obsidian Sync. You probably want to use Obsidian on multiple devices, so a phone, iPad, or computer. Because the files are local to your device, you need a way to keep those versions in sync. You can totally sync your files using Dropbox, iCloud, or Google Drive. There are many different services out there, but we make our Obsidian Sync service. We think it’s the best one because it’s totally integrated into the app, and it has a few features like version history. It’s end-to-end encrypted, so it’s much more secure than a lot of the other options by default. So, that is one of our major revenue drivers. \nPublish is another service where you can take your notes in Obsidian and make a website out of it. Then, we also have a couple donation programs, which are Catalyst and our commercial license where users who want access to the beta versions or want to support us because they believe in what we’re doing can essentially send us money. \nSo, those are the main ways that we make money. We have merch, but it’s actually all breakeven, so we don’t really make any profit from that. The thing is, because the team is small, we don’t need mountains of cash. It’s just us and some computers, so it’s not like there’s a large amount of expenses. So it works.\nIs it profitable?\nYes. It’s been profitable pretty much since day one. Since I think even before Sync launched —  the donation program, Catalyst, was the first thing that launched —  so it’s been profitable for five years.\nLet me ask the other big Decoder question. How do you make decisions at your company? Do you have a framework?\nWe have this manifesto that you can look at. In a way, I think that is our most powerful driver because it describes our values, which are to make this app that’s super private, super customizable, and durable around  these files that hopefully you’ll be able to own for the rest of your life. The community is always driving us towards the next big problem. \nFor example, last year one of the big things we started working on was Web Clipper. A lot of other apps have something like it. I think Evernote was probably the first one that did a really good job with this back in the day. Then, there are services like Pocket that shut down recently. A lot of people in the community were saying, “Hey, this is a major hole, a gap for Obsidian. All these other apps have great web clipping tools.” So, we built one. I think that whether it’s through plugins or through just general complaining from the compute community, we kind of know what the biggest gaps are. So, we always have a general idea of what we want to work on next. \nBut there’s also a self-motivated aspect to it. Because our team uses it all day, someone will become an advocate or champion for something. For example, I’m always using the iOS app, and I’m always coming across edge cases where I feel like there’s too much friction. There are other people on our team who use Android, use Linux, or who use Obsidian in a slightly different way. It kind of becomes your mission internally. \nI don’t think this is really that different from other companies. But it kind of becomes your flag to raise with the rest of the team and convince them that this is an important problem that we have to work on now. Because the organization is so flat, we can make decisions very easily. It’s also very easy for one person to go off and prototype something for a few days and show it to the team and say, “Hey, solve this problem. Help me get this polished so we can release it.” \nSo, that makes it really, really fun. And because we don’t have investors or any top-down pressure forcing any deadlines, it’s very self-motivated. I’m sure there are lots of people in the community who wish we would release things faster, but we don’t want to give up the freedom, flexibility, and joy that we have building it.\nLet me end on a few questions about the future. Virtually every major company that’s making a productivity tool is incorporating some generative AI feature or integrating an AI plugin or API. What is the Obsidian view on AI and productivity tools? Will you add features like that?\nSo far, there are no AI options built into Obsidian except in Web Clipper, which is intentional because it lives outside of Obsidian itself. In Web Clipper, we have a feature called Interpreter that allows you to put in a bunch of prompts or questions at the time you’re capturing a webpage, like if you want to fill in metadata about that page or say who the author is. \nLet’s say you’re saving products because you’re doing research on what podcasting microphone you want to buy next. You could grab all the metadata and specifications automatically just by putting in a prompt, and it will kind of save all of that. But that’s living outside of Obsidian and it’s not about replacing your thinking. I think the fear I have with AI is that I don’t want it to replace thinking in my own use, the insights that I’m going to gather with a summary generated by AI.\nNow, there are tons of people using AI with Obsidian. Because of the plugin architecture, AI is by far the most popular category of new, up-and-coming plugins right now. There are a lot of plugins that people are making using AI. A lot of the LLMs are very knowledgeable about Obsidian and its API. You can just go into Claude and say, “Hey, make me an Obsidian plugin that this or that.” That’s a big challenge for us because there’s a mountain of plugins growing really quickly that we need to review, and it’s happening faster than we can keep up with because AI makes it so easy to make plugins.\nOh, wow.\nSo, AI is definitely being used. Our philosophy as far as how it would ever make sense for Obsidian is that it has to fit with the principles that are in our manifesto, which is that it would have to be private. We’re not comfortable with the idea that our users’ data could be stored in OpenAI servers without their consent. I think a lot of tools out there are just kind of defaulting to this feeling that there’s an arms race. We’ve got to put AI into everything. Let’s put a little magic button everywhere. I don’t think that’s us. We want to give users confidence that their thoughts are theirs, that things are not going to be used to train the next LLM.\nThat said, I do think AI can be really powerful for certain uses. So the question is, in the long term, do we end up giving an API to the plugin community so that they can build those types of functionalities more easily? Right now, we’re not working on it. We’ve been holding off and watching what’s going on. We don’t feel a sense of urgency to suddenly put all these things in there because, to be honest, the plugin ecosystem is there for you and you can do it if you really want that. There are things much more important to us on the priority list that we want to work on first, that we would rather set our time aside for with our limited capacity.\nLet’s talk about the medium to long-term future of Obsidian. What does it look like when 95 percent of its features are built? What do you hope it does that it can’t quite do today?\nThe sands are always shifting. We have operating systems that are changing. We’re built on top of macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. We have to keep Obsidian working on all those platforms. That work is never-ending and challenging. But it’s hard to imagine what would happen first: we run out of ideas and features or something radically different comes along that people want to use instead of Obsidian. I have this point of view that Obsidian is not necessarily going to last forever. \nThere’s going to be a point in time — I don’t know if it’s in five years, one year, 10 years, 50 years — where we’re not going to be using these exact same kinds of apps. I don’t know what is going to replace it, or if we’re even going to be using computers in the same way. Interfaces may change very radically. I’m not sure what it is. I do feel confident that the files you create will end up being really important in that new world. We’re seeing that with AI actually because it turns out that all of the LLMs speak Markdown and are using it behind the scenes because it’s just plain text, and that’s what LLMs are good at. \nBut I don’t know the answer to your question. It’s hard to imagine a world where we completely run out of ideas. It seems more likely that we will just die of old age as an app. Maybe five years from now we will have some other idea for an app that we want to work on. But it’s hard to imagine just running out of things to work on.\nWhat’s the next thing that you’re working on?\nRight now, it’s a feature called Bases. The idea is that you can store properties, or metadata about the current file, in Obsidian notes. For example, if I have a note about Decoder, I might put the name of the host and a list of episodes. For each episode that I want to take notes on, I might write down which guests were on, what date it came out, or the episode number. What Bases allows you to do is visualize a certain kind of note as a table or eventually as a Kanban view or another type of view. So, it’s like a visualization layer on top of the data that you already have. We just make it really easy to create that database from the bottom up.\nIt’s kind of like a backward database because all the data is already in there. You’re just looking at it and saying, “Show me all notes that have the ‘books’ tag,” for example, or a link to “Casey.” Then, I get a table and then I have all my metadata, which I can edit. It’s quite powerful if you’re someone who enjoys tracking books that you read, or the movies that you watch, the places that you go, the articles you’ve read. You can very easily create these structures or do project management. \nSo, we’re having a lot of fun with that. It’s been way more popular than we expected. It’s currently in beta, so hopefully we will be releasing the first public version in the near future. Then, I expect that we’re going to be working on this until the end of the year or even longer because the feedback has been so positive.\nWell, if you want to send any of those notes that you took about me, I can take a look and let you know if there are any errors.\nYes, no problem. Just don’t get too obsessed with tweaking the fonts and everything.\n[Laughs] I’ll try not to. I’m always at risk of doing that. Steph, thank you so much for joining us today.\nThank you, Casey. It was great.\nQuestions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com. We really do read every email!",

      "raw": "Bluetooth trackers come in all shapes and sizes. | Illustration: Cath Virginia / The Verge\t\n\nSome people rarely lose things. Wallets are always exactly where they’re supposed to be, keys never go missing, and remotes never slip between the couch cushions. And then there’s the rest of us — the folks who can’t ever seem to find the thing that was right there a few seconds ago. For us, there are Bluetooth trackers.\nBluetooth trackers have been around for a long time, and they all generally work the same way. You stick the tracker onto an object, pair it with your phone, and then, when you lose said object, you can go into an app and ring the tracker. But these days, Bluetooth trackers can do a lot more. Some have ultra-wideband chips that enable precision tracking, so you can find exactly where in a room your item is. Increasingly, trackers also tap into large networks — like Apple’s and Google’s — making it easier to locate lost items outside the home. Many will notify you if they detect you’ve left the device behind or come with QR codes that link to your contact information so people can easily return lost devices.\nThese features are incredibly handy but also have the potential for misuse. Take AirTags. When Apple launched the trackers, it hadn’t anticipated they’d be used to track people or stolen items — but that’s exactly what happened. It’s since beefed up its anti-stalking features, and companies like Tile have also followed suit. Apple and Google have launched a standard that enables unwanted tracking alerts across both Android and iOS devices — and major players like Tile, Samsung, and Chipolo are on board. But until this standard is up and running, it pays to be aware of each tracker’s current approach when you’re deciding the best option for you.\nAs a consummate Loser of Things, I’ve tested my fair share of Bluetooth trackers on wallets, keys, and luggage. Here’s what I’d recommend if you, too, have a hard time finding things.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best tracker for iPhone users\nThe best Bluetooth tracker for Android users\nThe best AirTag and Tile alternative\nThe best AirTag alternatives for wallets\nOther Bluetooth trackers to consider\nWhat’s coming next\n\nThe best tracker for iPhone users\nApple AirTag\nApple’s AirTags can help you find your lost items with their ultra wideband technology. You’ll get the best compatibility with an iPhone, though Apple released an Android app that can detect an AirTag’s location and notify you if one seems to be following you.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29 $24 at Amazon\n $29 $24 at Walmart\n $29 $24.99 at Best Buy\n\nWhen Apple launched AirTags in 2021, it really did shake up the category. That’s because AirTags are equipped with Apple’s Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip and tap into Apple’s vast Find My network. That’s a potent combo. And even though you can now get third-party accessories that work with the Find My network — including the Pebblebee trackers featured later in this guide — AirTags are still the best, thanks to UWB. \nBasically, UWB enables precision tracking while Find My compatibility expands range far, far beyond Bluetooth’s limitations. With precision tracking, all you have to do is open the Find My app, tap “Find,” and you should see an arrow pointing you in the exact direction you need to go to find your item. Using the Find My network also means that so long as there’s an Apple device nearby, a lost AirTag can ping its location to Apple’s iCloud servers without notifying the owners of those other devices. And there are over a billion Apple products out there.\nThat accuracy is super convenient. My keys fell out of my pocket while running once, and I didn’t notice until my phone pinged me to say my keys were no longer with me. While I wasn’t able to use the precision tracking outdoors, I could see the last reported location in the Find My app. Twenty minutes had already passed, but I still was able to find my keys. I haven’t had that degree of success with any other item tracker.\nHowever, this accuracy is a double-edged sword. In 2022, I ran a test to see whether I could track a friend and my spouse (with their consent) in real time. And I could, to a disturbing degree. While Apple’s unwanted tracking prevention measures worked, there were also inherent flaws. (You can read about our testing in full here.) However, Apple has since improved unwanted tracking alerts by shortening the time before you’re notified an unknown AirTag is in your vicinity, making chimes louder, and creating a separate app that lets Android users scan for unknown AirTags. Apple also now informs users during setup that unwanted tracking is a crime and that AirTags are “intended solely to track items that belong to you.”\nApple has also added more ways to share AirTag locations with trusted people. iOS 17 introduced AirTag sharing, which means shared items won’t trigger unwanted tracking alerts. As of iOS 18.2, you can also share the location of a lost AirTag with other people via a temporary link. So if an airline loses your luggage, you can send them a link that shows them an interactive map of your item’s last known location. (Apple is partnering with more than 15 airlines for this particular use case.)\nThe only thing I really don’t like about AirTags is they aren’t truly $29. They’re $29 plus the cost of whatever accessory is needed to attach them to the item you want to track. For example, you’ll need a holder to attach it to your keys or luggage. Thankfully, there’s a robust third-party accessory market, so you don’t have to pay Apple’s prices if you don’t want to. The fact that you can easily replace the battery with a regular CR2032 coin cell battery helps take the sting out, too. I just did it for two of my AirTags, and it was much, much cheaper than having to buy two new ones.\nRead our original AirTags review.\nThe best Bluetooth tracker for Android users\nTile Pro\nThe Tile Pro is the company’s loudest Bluetooth tracker and has the widest range at 400 feet. It also has a user-replaceable battery, unlike other Tiles.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $34.99 $24.99 at Amazon\n $34.99 $24.99 at Best Buy\n $34.99 $27.99 at Target\n\nMore and more trackers now support both Google’s and Apple’s Find My networks, but Tile’s trackers — especially the $34.99 Tile Pro — are still our top recommendation for Android users or mixed iOS / Android households. Functionally, the platform-agnostic trackers can do just about anything an AirTag can. Like AirTags, Tile devices can tap into a larger network — in this case, the Tile Network and Amazon Sidewalk — to help you find your devices outside of your phone’s Bluetooth range. While this network isn’t as expansive as Apple’s or Google’s, Amazon Sidewalk’s coverage has improved significantly. In our April 2025 testing of Google’s Find Hub-compatible trackers — including the Chipolo Pop, Pebblebee Clip Universal, and the Moto Tag — we found that Tile still did better at tracking items outside the home. \nUnfortunately, Tile still can’t do true real-time tracking, and it still doesn’t offer a tracker with UWB, so it lacks the AirTag’s precision tracking. The company announced one back in 2021, but we’re still waiting, partly because Apple is effectively blocking UWB compatibility for third parties in iOS and because Tile’s priorities shifted once it was acquired by Life360. \nA note about Google’s Find Hub network\nIn 2024, Google finally launched its Find My Device network, which was recently renamed Find Hub. It works similarly to Apple’s Find My network: you’ll be able to share trackers with family members, and there are also unwanted tracking alerts.\nInitially, the network lagged behind Apple’s, but it’s starting to catch up. After several weeks of testing Find Hub-compatible trackers — specifically the Chipolo Pop, Pebblebee Clip Universal, and Moto Tag — in April 2025, we found the network’s improved significantly over the past year, more so in busy areas. Still, it’s clear Google prioritized privacy over precision.\nThat balance may shift, though. In May 2025, Google added UWB support for more accurate tracking with Motorola’s Moto Tag and, eventually, other compatible phones and trackers. Google also plans to roll out satellite connectivity later later in 2025, with the ability to share tracker locations with airline staff arriving in early 2026.\nThat said, Life360’s acquisition has brought some meaningful upgrades. Pressing a Tile button three times now sends an SOS alert to emergency contacts through Life360. You can also add others to your Circle so they can view and ring nearby Tiles on a shared Life360 map. More recently, Tile trackers have become fully integrated into Life360, letting users manage their trackers directly within the Life360 app. This merger unlocked a few premium features for free, including push alerts for forgotten items and two-day location history.\nStill, most of the good stuff — like 30-day location history, unlimited sharing with friends and family, free replacements for damaged Tiles, and up to $100 reimbursement for lost items — sits behind a $29.99/year subscription. Fortunately, Tile offers new members a one-year free trial, and one subscription covers all your devices. You also still get a lot of core functionality without paying: you can find your Tile via Bluetooth, view its last known location on a map, ring your phone from the Tile, and share access with one other person for free.\nTile also stands out for its versatility. While AirTags come in a single puck-like design, Tile offers four distinct form factors to suit different needs. The card-shaped Tile Slim ($19.99), for example, is the best option if you’re constantly losing your wallet. The square Tile Mate ($19.99) comes with a hole so you can stick it on a key ring or carabiner, and is probably the most versatile. The $19.99 Tile Sticker, meanwhile, is a small disc that comes with a sticky backing so you can put it on remotes, pet collars, and anything else you can stick it on.\nThe best Tile will depend on what you’re looking to track. My personal favorite, however, is the $34.99 Tile Pro, which is shaped like a key fob, is larger than the Mate, and can also be attached to other items. Of the four, it has the longest Bluetooth range at 500 feet and the loudest ring. It’s also the only one that has a replaceable one-year CR2032 battery. \nLast but not least, Tile may actually be better than AirTags for tracking stolen items. The company rolled out an anti-theft feature in 2023, which renders Tile devices invisible to unwanted tracking detection in the event someone steals your item. Just know that to use it, Tile requires you to submit a government ID for verification, agree to Tile working with law enforcement without a subpoena, and consent to a $1 million fine if you misuse this feature. For anti-stalking measures, Tile also has a “Scan and Secure” feature, which allows you to use the Tile app to scan for unknown Tile devices in your vicinity. While better than nothing, it’s a flawed measure, as it requires the potential victim to proactively scan their surroundings. \n\n\nThe best AirTag and Tile alternative\nPebblebee Clip Universal\nThe Pebblebee Clip Universal supports Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, but also has a 500-foot Bluetooth range, LEDs that flash to help you locate it, and a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 12 months on a single charge.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $34.99 at Pebblebee\n $34.99 at Amazon\n $34.99 at Best Buy\n\nIf you’re looking for an AirTag or Tile alternative, the Pebblebee Clip Universal is an excellent choice. It’s one of a growing number of trackers that support both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, a major improvement over its predecessor. This makes setup seamless for both iOS and Android users, while also enabling more accurate and reliable tracking than Pebblebee’s own network could provide. \nThe thing I like best about the Pebblebee Clip Universal is its rechargeable battery. A single charge lasts up to one year, up from six months — though you may get longer than that depending on your usage. It has a USB-C port, too, so you don’t have to sweat it if you lose the charger it comes with. You love to see it.\nThe Pebblebee Clip Universal also has an LED strip at the bottom that lights up when you ring the tracker. That’s helped me spot my car keys more quickly when they’ve fallen under the car seat or other dark areas. The ringtone is also quite loud, and the 500-foot Bluetooth range is actually about 100 feet more than the Tile Pro, our pick for Android users. And while larger than an AirTag, the Pebblebee Clip Universal also comes with a snap-on key ring so you don’t have to buy another accessory to attach it. It’s also IPX6-rated for water resistance.\nClip Universal owners can still use Pebblebee’s app to set voice tags and ask Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant to help find their device. You can also use the “Find Phone” feature, which lets you double-tap to ring your phone.\nPebblebee recently added a free “panic alarm” safety feature that’s similar to Tile’s SOS alert. Compatible with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub network, the Alert feature lets you press the Clip’s button to activate a loud 97-decibel siren and flashing light, which you can disable via Silent Mode. No matter what, the Pebblebee app will still text your location to a trusted contact — or up to five people, with live location sharing if you pay for the $2.99 Alert Live subscription. \nThat said, Clip Universal owners can’t use the Pebblebee app for tracking, and so only last-gen Clip owners can take advantage of the Pebblebee app’s extensive customizable geofencing features. That means, for instance, Clip Universal owners can no longer set up custom areas on a map and be notified whenever a device enters or leaves the area. They also can’t use the app to designate safe zones, which was useful to avoid unnecessary “left behind” notifications in familiar places like home or work. The latter can be done in Apple’s Find My app, though Google’s Find Hub doesn’t yet have an equivalent feature.\nThe best AirTag alternatives for wallets\nPebblebee Card Universal\nThe Pebblebee Card has a rechargeable battery that lasts for up to 18 months. It supports Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub, but you can also use the Pebblebee app for voice tagging.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $34.99 at Pebblebee\n $34.99 at Amazon\n $34.99 at Best Buy\n\nYou could be like my spouse, who stuffs an AirTag in their bifold wallet and then makes a surprised Pikachu face every time it falls out. Or, you could opt for a Find My-compatible alternative specifically designed for wallets, like the $34.99 Pebblebee Card Universal. It plays nice with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, giving you cross-platform flexibility and the benefits of each — all with a super loud ringtone. It doesn’t come with precision tracking because it lacks UWB, but it makes up for it with those loud ringtones. As part of the Find My network, it also supports unwanted tracking alerts. \nThe Pebblebee Card Universal also stands out because of its rechargeable battery, which lasts up to 18 months on a single charge. Like the Pebblebee Clip Universal, it works with the Pebblebee app to support voice tagging and even has a button you can press to locate your phone. \nOther Bluetooth trackers to consider\nChipolo Pop\nThe $29 Chipolo Pop offers a similar form factor to Apple’s AirTag in a lighter, more colorful package with a hole for a keychain or lanyard, a louder beep, and compatibility with both Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks (though only one at a time). You can even use the Pop as a remote camera shutter and press the built-in button twice to find your lost phone. Unlike Chipolo’s other trackers, it boasts a wider 300-foot Bluetooth range, a more robust IP55 rating for water and dust resistance, and includes a user-replaceable battery that can last up to a year. \nIn my testing, tracking was accurate on both Apple’s and Google’s networks in most cases, Google’s struggled to track items outside my home as reliably as the Tile. And without UWB, the Pop couldn’t match the AirTag’s pinpoint precision. Still, the Chipolo app provides Android users with reliable out-of-range alerts and left-behind notifications — something Pebblebee and Moto Tag’s trackers lack —which, in my experience, triggered even faster than the AirTag and Tile. ~ Sheena Vasani, Commerce Writer\nSamsung SmartTag2\nIf you’re a Samsung Galaxy phone user, the $29.99 Samsung SmartTag2 gets you UWB tracking and can tap into the Galaxy Find network, which operates similarly to Apple’s Find My network. It’s a great AirTag alternative but isn’t our overall pick for Android because it’s limited to Samsung Galaxy users. But for Samsung users, the latest SmartTag2 includes an improved Compass View, longer battery life, and a better app experience. It’s also got a newer oblong design with a larger key ring than the original SmartTag.\nEufy Security SmartTrack Card \nThe $16.88 $29.99 Eufy Security SmartTrack Card is another good option designed for wallets. It comes with a little clip attachment so it doesn’t have to be stuffed in your wallet; you could clip it onto a laptop case, for example. This also has the same benefits when used with the Find My network as the Pebblebee Card Universal. On the back, there’s also a QR code — similar to the ones Tile uses — that helps good samaritans return your item to you. Like the Pebblebee Card Universal, you can share it with multiple people if you set it up via the Eufy Security app. The bummer here is it doesn’t work with Android, lacks UWB and a replaceable battery, and isn’t rechargeable like its successor, Eufy’s $29.99 34.99 SmartTrack Card E30. That said, though, the built-in battery should purportedly last you three years.\nChipolo Card Spot and Card Point\nThe $35 Chipolo Card Spot or $24 $35 Card Point is also a good option for wallets if you want something a bit simpler, though it lacks the QR code, and its battery only lasts two years. If you do opt for Chipolo, double-check that the specific tracker you’re buying works on the network you want to use. For example, the Chipolo Card and Chipolo Card Spot can both be used with iPhones, but the Chipolo Card only works with the Chipolo app, while the Card Spot only works with Find My. The Chipolo Card Point is for Android users and works with Google’s Find Hub network. Read my full Chipolo Card Spot review.\nWhat’s coming next\nMotorola’s $29 Moto Tag is the first tracker on Google’s Find Hub network to offer UWB for locating lost items, which is functionality Google recently enabled via a firmware update. Even more conveniently, it’s compatible with Apple’s Find My network, too, and is designed to fit in accessories made for AirTags. The Moto Tag also carries an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance and comes with a replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery that should last up to a year. Like Pebblebee’s trackers, it can ring your phone if you’ve misplaced it. As a bonus, it doubles as a remote shutter for Motorola phone cameras. \nUpdate, August 18th: Added our impressions of the Chipolo Pop and mentioned Pebblebee’s new panic alarm feature. Updated pricing and availability information. Sheena Vasani also contributed to this guide.",

      "raw": "You can currently get an Apple Watch for $649.99 ($150 off).\t\n\nIf you’re interested in a long-lasting smartwatch, and like to stay within Apple’s hardware ecosystem, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is the best choice. It’s Apple’s most durable, longest-lasting smartwatch, and it’s currently on sale for $649.99 ($150 off), an all-time low price at Amazon and Best Buy. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in a single case size (49mm), material (titanium), and configuration (GPS + Cellular), so the only choice you have to make is which band best fits your style.\nApple Watch Ultra 2\nThe rugged Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in one size: 49mm. It offers the brightest display of any wearable in Apple’s lineup, along with better battery life and improved performance. It sports Apple’s new S9 SiP, too, allowing you to take advantage of Apple’s new double tap feature. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $649 at Amazon\n $799 $649 at Best Buy\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2’s battery lasted roughly two and a half days in our tests, and Apple says you can get up to 72 hours with low power mode enabled. If you have the right accessories, you can charge the Apple Watch Ultra 2 from zero to 80 percent in under an hour. The smartwatch’s S9 SiP processor is powerful enough to handle on-device Siri queries, and enables the double tap gesture, which allows you to scroll or interact with buttons on its display by tapping your fingers instead of the screen. Apple introduced the S10 SiP with the Apple Watch Series 10 last year, but the Apple Watch Ultra 2’s processor is still plenty powerful. \nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 supports several health and wellness features, including sleep apnea detection, fall detection, crash detection, sleep tracking, and heart tracking. The watch will send you a notification if it detects atrial fibrillation, and allows you to take an EKG (electrocardiogram) on device. Apple recently re-enabled the Apple Watch’s ability to monitor your blood oxygen level, though you’ll need to review the readings within your iPhone’s health app. When you exercise, you can select from a list of dozens of workout types to accurately log your fitness routine. \nApple has traditionally announced Apple Watch hardware updates at its iPhone event typically held in September, and rumors suggest the Apple Watch Ultra 3 will have a larger display, but the Ultra 2 is an excellent choice at its sale price.\nThree more great deals \nIf you need a small Bluetooth speaker to take to the beach, Soundcore Select 4 Go is down to $24.99 ($10 off) at Amazon. Its IP67 rating means it shouldn’t get damaged after being submerged under a meter of water for up to half an hour. However, the speaker is designed to float safely for a limited amount of time, so it shouldn’t stay under the surface for long. Soundcore says the Select 4 Go can last up to 20 hours per charge. Its built-in handle makes it easy to carry, and allows you to easily attach it to a backpack using a carabiner. \nAura’s Mason 9 is a Wi-Fi-enabled digital picture frame that makes it easy to display your favorite photos in a common area, and it’s $119.99 ($80 off) at Woot. Once the frame is connected to the internet, you can send photos and videos to Aura’s servers via app on your smartphone. The Mason 9 will cycle through the pictures and videos you’ve uploaded. Aura says you can upload an unlimited number of photos and videos to the server without paying a subscription fee.\nEufy’s Omni S1 Pro is a powerful robot vacuum and mop combo that takes most of the hard work out of keeping your floors clean, and it’s currently $949.99 ($550 off) at Amazon. The vacuum uses LiDAR sensors to create an accurate map of the rooms in your house, and will create a route to clean them as efficiently as possible. The Omni S1 Pro can clean both hard flooring and carpets, and will automatically empty dirty water and its dust bag into containers within its charging base. If you connect the Omni S1 Pro to the internet, you can set up a custom cleaning schedule, or start and stop a cleaning remotely.",
