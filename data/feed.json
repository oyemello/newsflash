      "raw": "Nintendo wouldn’t be Nintendo if it didn’t offer surprises every now and again. During its direct showcase, the company revealed more information on the sequel to The Super Mario Bros Movie — The Super Mario Galaxy Movie including a brand new trailer.\nThe teaser trailer was just that, a taste of what’s to come. It features Mario resting under a tree in the Mushroom Kingdom while a butterfly zooms up to space as the theme to Super Mario Galaxy begins to play.\nWe had some inkling Nintendo would go in the galaxy direction for its sequel. The first movie, which grossed over a billion dollars, spawned memes, and earned a Golden Globe nomination, hinted at a wider world beyond the Mushroom Kingdom. There’s also the fact that eagle-eyed internet sleuths found domains registered to NBC Universal, Nintendo’s movie production partner, that contained the name of the film. (An earlier leak also suggested the movie was titled “Super Mario World”.) \nAccording to Nintendo executive Shigeru Miyamoto, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be the centerpiece of Mario’s 40th anniversary celebration. Due out in April, Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Jack Black will reprise their roles as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Bowser.",

Starting next week, you’ll see an option to quote another user by selecting the repost — or “boost” — button, allowing you to add your thoughts to someone else’s post.\nThe decentralized platform initially planned not to launch quote posts over concerns that they could be used for harassment or to take someone out of context. Mastodon reversed this decision in February, saying a lack of quote posts might discourage people from joining the fediverse.\nMastodon is bringing quote posts to mastodon.online and mastodon.social first, but will roll out the feature more broadly with the Mastodon 4.5 update. If you don’t want someone to repost your content with a quote, Mastodon will let you disable quoting for all posts, or just for individual ones. You can also limit who quotes you to anyone on the platform, followers only, or just yourself, as well as remove your content from someone else’s quote post.\nMastodon notes that if you quote a post from another fediverse platform, “it may take some time for the quote to appear.” It also worked on a technical specification for quote posting in the fediverse and hopes that other platforms will adopt it. You can find more information about quote posts, as well as how to adjust your quote post settings, on Mastodon’s website.",

      "raw": "The iPhone Air is too slim for a SIM.\t\n\nApple has postponed preorders of the iPhone Air in mainland China, which were due to open today, with regulatory issues around eSIM almost certainly to blame.\nThe Chinese store page for the super-slim iPhone says that “release information will be updated later” (translated from Chinese). Apple had originally announced that the Air would go on preorder in China at the same time as in the US, 8AM ET today, with full availability from September 19th. Its other three new iPhones — the 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max — are all available to preorder now, and ship from next week.\nThe issue is most likely Apple’s decision to make the Air eSIM-only worldwide. eSIM has never been widely available in mainland China, and phones manufactured for the local market still don’t include support (which has tripped me up a few times when I’ve gone traveling in Europe with a review unit of a Chinese phone!). None of Apple’s previous iPhone support eSIM in China, nor do any of the three iPhone 17 models.\nEarlier this week Apple’s support page for eSIM in China declared that “China Unicom is the only supported eSIM carrier for iPhone.” That page has now been updated, and says that “pending regulatory approval” all three of the country’s state-owned main carriers will offer eSIM, including China Mobile and China Telecom.\nThe South China Morning Post reports that Apple has told Chinese media that it is “working closely with regulatory authorities to bring [the iPhone Air] to China as soon as possible.”",

      "raw": "The iPhone Air starts at $999. | Image: The Verge\t\n\nApple’s complete 2025 lineup, including the iPhone 17, the 17 Pro, the 17 Pro Max, and the thin iPhone Air, are available to preorder. They’ll be available next Friday, September 19th, and ordering now is how you can ensure you’ll be among the first to receive your order.\nBeyond the Air’s shockingly slim design, Apple’s latest iPhone lineup features a number of notable updates that seem worth upgrading for, especially if you have a phone that’s a few generations old. The standard iPhone 17 — which is a shockingly good value, by the way — now features a larger 6.3-inch display with ProMotion and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Meanwhile, the Pro model has returned to an aluminum build while adding the biggest battery of any iPhone yet. The iPhone Air and Pro models have a lot in common, including having a raised “plateau” bump on the back, which contains not just cameras but some internal components, too, leaving some extra room in the phones for larger batteries.\nThe iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and Air start at $799, $1,099, $1,199, and $999, respectively, and each model starts with 256GB of storage. Below, you’ll find more information about each new device, along with where you can place a preorder.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere to preorder the iPhone Air\nWhere to preorder the iPhone 17\nWhere to preorder the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max\nUS carrier deals and incentives\n\nWhere to preorder the iPhone Air\nThe iPhone Air finally made its debut after months of rumors. It’s Apple’s thinnest iPhone ever at 5.6mm thick, and it features a 6.5-inch ProMotion display and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Apple says the design is its “most durable” yet, with a ceramic shield that encloses a titanium frame on both sides (also found in the iPhone 17 Pro). The device also sports a single 48-megapixel fusion camera on the back, an 18-megapixel Center Stage selfie cam on its front, along with an A19 Pro processor and Apple’s in-house C1X modem. Despite its thinner design, Apple says the Air features “all-day battery life,” with up to 27 hours of video playback, or 40 hours when the $99 iPhone Air MagSafe battery is attached.\nThe iPhone Air is available to preorder at Apple and Best Buy, starting at $999 for 256GB of storage and going up to $1,399 for the 1TB model.\niPhone Air\nThe iPhone Air is Apple’s thinnest iPhone yet at 5.6mm, featuring a 6.5-inch ProMotion display, a 48MP fusion camera, and an 18MP front camera with Center Stage support. It also boasts the most Apple-designed chips in an iPhone: the A19 Pro, N1, and C1X.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 at Apple (256GB)\n $999.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $1199 at Apple (512GB)\n\nWhere to preorder the iPhone 17\nThe iPhone 17 is Apple’s latest entry-level smartphone, but this one seems a lot better than past models. Notably, it includes a larger 6.3-inch 120Hz ProMotion display — ripped straight from the iPhone 17 Pro. The device also features a new A19 processor, and a dual 48-megapixel fusion camera system that has a main camera and an ultrawide camera. A new 18-megapixel Center Stage front camera features a square sensor, allowing users to take high-quality landscape-mode selfies without having to rotate their phone.\nThe phone is available in five colors (black, lavender, mist blue, sage, and white) and features a starting storage of 256GB. Preorders for the iPhone 17 are now live at Apple and Best Buy, starting at $799.\niPhone 17\nThe standard iPhone 17 has a 6.3-inch ProMotion display that can reach 3,000 nits of peak brightness, an A19 chip, and a 48MP dual camera system. It also features an 18MP Center Stage selfie camera with a square sensor, allowing users to take landscape selfies while holding the device vertically. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 at Apple (256GB)\n $829.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $999 at Apple (512GB)\n\nWhere to preorder the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max look different than previous Pro models. While they keep the same 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays, respectively, Apple has made a few tweaks to the design. One of the first things you’ll probably notice is the plateau camera bump on the back, which houses a trio of 48-megapixel fusion cameras. Both devices also boast an upgraded 18-megapixel selfie camera with support for Center Stage, and a more powerful A19 Pro processor inside. The Pro models feature larger batteries than before, too, with the 17 Pro Max delivering the best battery life ever in an iPhone, according to Apple.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max launch alongside the others next Friday, September 19th. The smaller Pro starts at $1,099 for 256GB of storage, while the 17 Pro Max starts at $1,199 for 256GB of storage. For the first time ever, Apple is offering a 2TB configuration of the 17 Pro Max for $1,999. You can nab a preorder for the 17 Pro from Apple and Best Buy; the 17 Pro Max is also available for preorder at Apple and Best Buy.\niPhone 17 Pro\nThe iPhone 17 Pro features a 6.3-inch OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, and it’s powered by an A19 Pro chip. It features a 48MP triple camera system, plus a new “plateau” bar on the back, which Apple says creates additional space for internal components, including a larger battery.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1099 at Apple (256GB)\n $1099.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $1299 at Apple (512GB)\n\n\niPhone 17 Pro Max\nThe larger iPhone 17 Pro Max sports a 6.9-inch OLED screen and the best battery life ever in an iPhone. It has most of the same features as the smaller iPhone 17 Pro, though, but offers storage up to 2TB — a first in the iPhone line.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199 at Apple (256GB)\n $1199.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $1399 at Apple (512GB)\n\nUS carrier deals and incentives\nRather than pay all at once for your phone of choice, several US carriers are offering deals if you purchase or upgrade through them. Just keep in mind that taking advantage of a carrier deal will lock your phone to that network for a period of time, and likely mean you’ll break up the total price into payments that may increase your monthly bill.\nVerizon is offering new and existing customers who trade-in an eligible device up to $1,099 toward an iPhone 17 Pro with a new or upgraded smartphone line on an Unlimited Ultimate plan (minimum $90 per month with autopay, plus taxes and fees for 36 months); the trade-in / promo credit is applied over 36 months. Meanwhile, Verizon is offering new and existing customers who trade in an eligible device up to $1,100 off the iPhone 17 Pro Max with a new or upgraded smartphone line on an Unlimited Ultimate plan, with the trade-in / promo credit applied over 36 months. For upgrades, phones that are traded in must be active on an account for 60 days prior to purchasing a new device.\nT-Mobile is offering up to $1,100 off any 2025 iPhone in 24 monthly bill credits with an eligible trade-in and qualifying service ($100+ per month with auto pay, plus taxes and fees). Meanwhile, you can get up to $830 (no trade-in required) via 24 monthly bill credits when you switch to T-Mobile and add a line on one of its Experience plans.\nAT&T is offering new and existing customers up to $1,100 off an iPhone 17 Pro or 17 Pro Max, and up to $830 off an iPhone 17 or iPhone Air, with the credit being applied over 36 months. The offer is available for new and existing customers with an eligible trade-in in any condition, and activation of a new line or an upgrade of an existing line. For new customers, AT&T says the offer requires a postpaid unlimited voice and data plan starting at $75.99 before the discounts.\nUpdate, September 12th: Updated to note the new 2025 iPhone models are now available to preorder.",

      "raw": "The Xperia 10 VII’s camera bar looks Pixel-perfect.\t\n\nSony has announced the Xperia 10 VII, a midrange Android phone that’s launching in the UK, Europe, and Asia, though not the US. It’s more notable than most Sony phones because it marks the first major change to the rear design in over five years: a camera bar, just like recent Pixels, and now even iPhones.\nThe Xperia Android line has kept its cameras vertically stacked in one corner since the first-generation Xperia 5 in 2019, with only rare exceptions like the standalone Xperia Pro-I. But the 10 VII reinvents that design language with a horizontal camera pair mounted in a pill-shaped raised bar that stretches across the phone’s back. The matte plastic body comes in black, white, or turquoise, and looks like no Xperia phone before it. It looks a little more like Google’s Pixel phones, a design also aped by Apple’s iPhone Air this week.\nThings are more recognizable from the front, with Sony’s familiar insistence on a chunky bezel above and below the display. That means the phone isn’t quite as compact as its 120Hz 6.1-inch display would suggest, but it’s still smaller and lighter than most. It also follows the recent Xperia 1 models in ditching what used to be a trademark 21:9 aspect ratio, now using boxier and more traditional 19.5:9 proportions.\nThere are a few other standard Sony touches though. Most welcome for some will be the 3.5mm headphone jack, and the same crowd are likely to love the expandable microSD storage. The big bezel packs front-facing stereo speakers too, and the joint IP65 / 68 rating is better than most offer. There’s also a side-mounted single-stage camera shutter button — a feature that’s less unique than it used to be.\nOtherwise, this is a pretty by-the-numbers midranger. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chipset is no powerhouse, and the dual rear cameras — a 50-megapixel main and 13-megapixel ultrawide — sound typical for the price. The 5,000mAh battery should last for two days according to Sony, but charging is limited to wired.\nI’ve always liked the look of Sony’s modern phones, even if they’ve often lagged behind the competition elsewhere. They were beginning to look a little dated though, and I’m a definite fan of the new design. Sony recently reiterated that the Xperia phones are “very important” to it — hopefully this redesign is a sign of some commitment to the line, and that we’ll see it extend to next year’s flagship model too.\nThe Xperia 10 VII costs €449 / £399 (around $530) and is available to preorder now in the UK and Europe, shipping from September 19th.",

      "raw": "Microsoft has avoided a fine from the European Commission after it was charged with EU antitrust violations for bundling its Teams app with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 subscriptions. The European Commission says it has accepted commitments from Microsoft to address competition concerns related to Microsoft Teams, following an anti-competitive complaint filed by Slack in July 2020.\n“The commitments address the Commission’s concerns related to the tying of Microsoft Teams to the company’s popular productivity applications Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, included in its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites for business customers,” says the European Commission.\nMicrosoft has committed to do the following:\nMake available versions of its Office suites without Teams and at a reduced price\nAllow customers with long-term licenses to switch to suites without Teams\nProvide interoperability for key functionalities between communication and collaboration tools that compete with Teams and certain Microsoft products\nAllow customers to move their data out of Teams to facilitate the use of competing solutions\nMost of the commitments from Microsoft will be enforced by EU lawmakers for seven years, with the interoperability and data portability ones in force for 10 years. Microsoft originally unbundled Teams from Office in Europe in 2023 in an attempt to address regulator concerns, and then spun off Teams from Office 365 as its own separate app globally last year.\n“Organizations big and small across Europe and around the world rely heavily on videoconferencing, chat and collaboration tools, especially since the coronavirus pandemic,” says Teresa Ribera, executive vice president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission. “Today’s decision therefore opens up competition in this crucial market, and ensures that businesses can freely choose the communication and collaboration product that best suits their needs.”\nEU lawmakers first opened a Microsoft antitrust investigation into Teams bundling in 2023, after Slack filed its anti-competitive complaint amid intense competition with Microsoft that developed after the covid-19 pandemic began. Slack’s original complaint alleged that Microsoft had “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.”",

      "raw": "Asus’ ProArt P16 laptop is getting RTX 50-series GPUs and a unique new screen in its high-end configuration. Its biggest upgrades include Nvidia’s top-tier RTX 5090 mobile GPU and a bright 16-inch 3840 x 2400 tandem OLED touchscreen, capable of up to 1,600 nits of brightness in HDR and 120Hz refresh with VRR. The new flagship P16 will cost $3,999.99 at Best Buy and direct from Asus when it launches internationally in mid-October and in the US in December.\nOther key specs and features of the P16 include an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU (same as the 2024 model), 64GB of LPDDR5X RAM, 4TB of SSD storage (via two 2TB NVMe drives), Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 5.4. It’s also got a bunch of ports, including one 40Gbps USB4, one 10Gbps USB-C 3.2 Gen 2, two 10Gbps USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, HDMI 2.1, a 3.5mm audio jack, and SD Express 7.0 card slot.\nIt’s a whole lot of laptop, designed to be a direct Windows alternative to a 16-inch MacBook Pro (it even comes in all black). Like previous P16s, it’s basically a creator-focused version of the Intel-based Asus ROG Zephyrus G16. That means it’s fairly thin at 14.9mm / 0.59 inches, and at 1.95kg / 4.3 pounds it’s decently light for its size. It also means it’s likely to have at least a little thermal throttling under the heaviest of loads from creative apps and graphically intensive games — as has been the case for the Zephyrus laptops. And Asus’ tech specs track with that, as the P16’s 5090 GPU is rated for up to 120W total graphics power (TGP), though the card can potentially go up to 150W according to Nvidia.\nStill, just like the ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16 are excellent gaming laptops (particularly if you value portability), the new P16 sounds pretty good for a creative laptop — at least on paper. To cater it more toward creators than the Zephyrus line, Asus put that brighter tandem OLED screen with more resolution and touch compatibility in the new flagship config. The P16 also features Asus’ DialPad, a ring-shaped dial built into the trackpad for extra control of sliders in creative apps like those from Adobe.\nIf $4,000 is too high an asking price, Asus is also keeping the entry-level 2024 model with an RTX 4060 around for $1,999.99. And there are mid-tier options for the new 2025 version with RTX 5070 and 5080 GPU options, the former of which starts at $2,499.99 and sports the same AMD Ryzen 370HX CPU, 32GB of RAM, 2TB SSD, and a non-tandem 4K / 60Hz OLED display. Not as fancy-sounding as Asus’ halo config, but not too shabby either.",
