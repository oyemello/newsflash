We are actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement. Together, we remain focused on delivering the best AI tools for everyone, grounded in our shared commitment to safety.\nMicrosoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI since 2019, and shares in the revenue earned by ChatGPT as well as its API. Microsoft also now includes OpenAI as a competitor, allows OpenAI to lean on other cloud providers for compute power, and has started to increase its reliance on its own AI models. \nIn a company town hall meeting on Thursday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and AI chief Mustafa Suleyman committed to “significant investments” in its own models. “We should have the capacity to build world class frontier models in house of all sizes, but we should be very pragmatic and use other models where we need to,” said Suleyman.\nThere was one specific detail about the agreement with Microsoft released by OpenAI in another statement, saying that its nonprofit parent company will continue to hold authority over the for-profit business, with an equity stake worth more than $100 billion. \nOther philanthropies and nonprofits have reportedly pushed back against OpenAI’s unusual restructuring plan, and the attorneys general of California and Delaware have opened investigations. In its announcement, OpenAI said, “We continue to work with the California and Delaware Attorneys General as an important part of strengthening our approach, and we remain committed to learning and acting with urgency to ensure our tools are helpful and safe for everyone, while advancing safety as an industry-wide priority.”",

Claude’s memory also carries over to projects, a feature that lets Pro and Teams generate things like diagrams, website designs, graphics, and more, based on files they upload to the chatbot. \nIt seems to be particularly focused on work-related details, like a “team’s processes” and “client needs.” Anthropic notes that memory is “fully optional.”\nAnthropic says users can view and edit the memory Claude has stored from their settings menu. “Based on what you tell Claude to focus on or to ignore, Claude will adjust the memories it references,” Anthropic says. Both OpenAI and Google have already launched cross-chat memories for their chatbots. Last month, a report from The New York Times linked ChatGPT’s rollout of cross-chat memories to an increase in reports of “delusional” AI chats.\nAlong with memories, Anthropic is rolling out incognito chats for all users, which Claude won’t save to its chat history or refer to in future chats.

      "raw": "Earlier today, the FBI shared two blurry photos on X of a person of interest in the shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. Numerous users replied with AI-upscaled, “enhanced” versions of the pictures almost immediately, turning the pixelated surveillance shots into sharp, high-resolution images. But AI tools aren’t uncovering secret details in a fuzzy picture, they’re inferring what might be there — and they have a track record of showing things that don’t exist.\nMany AI-generated photo variations were posted under the original images, some apparently created with X’s own Grok bot, others with tools like ChatGPT. They vary in plausibility, though some are obviously off, like an “AI-based textual rendering” showing a clearly different shirt and Gigachad-level chin. The images are ostensibly supposed to help people find the person of interest, although they’re also eye-grabbing ways to get likes and reposts.\nBut it’s unlikely any of them are more helpful than the FBI’s photos. In past incidents, AI upscaling has done things like “depixelating” a low-resolution picture of President Barack Obama into a white man and adding a nonexistent lump to President Donald Trump’s head. It extrapolates from an existing image to fill in gaps, and while that can be useful under certain circumstances, you definitely shouldn’t treat it as hard evidence in a manhunt.\nHere is the original post from the FBI, for reference:\n\n\nWe are asking for the public's help identifying this person of interest in connection with the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. \n1-800-CALL-FBI\nDigital media tips: https://t.co/K7maX81TjJ pic.twitter.com/ALuVkTXuDc\n— FBI Salt Lake City (@FBISaltLakeCity) September 11, 2025\n\n\nAnd below are some examples of attempted “enhancements.”",

The aesthetics of the website are cool and calming, with a logo of converging arrows reminiscent of the idea of togetherness and sets of parallel lines swirling behind black font. \nBut stay on the page for 30 seconds and the swirls spell out “bullshit,” giving away that CAAAC is all one big joke. One second longer and you’ll notice the hidden gems tucked away in every sentence and page of the fantasy center’s website. \nCAAAC launched Tuesday from the same team that brought us The Box, a literal, physical box that women can wear on dates to avoid the threat of their image being turned into AI-generated deepfake slop. \n“This website is the most important thing that anyone will read about AI in this millenium or the next,” said CAAAC cofounder Louis Barclay, staying in character when talking to The Verge. (The second founder of CAAAC wished to remain anonymous, according to Barclay.) \nCAAAC’s vibe is so similar to AI alignment research labs — who are featured on the website’s homepage with working links to their own websites — that even those in the know initially thought it was real, including Kendra Albert, a machine learning researcher and technology attorney, who spoke with The Verge. \nCAAAC makes fun of the trend, according to Albert, of those who want to make AI safe drifting away from the “real problems happening in the real world” — such as bias in models, exacerbating the energy crisis, or replacing workers — to the “very, very theoretical” risks of AI taking over the world, Albert said in an interview with The Verge. \nTo fix the “AI alignment alignment crisis,” CAAAC will be recruiting its global workforce exclusively from the Bay Area. All are welcome to apply, “as long as you believe AGI will annihilate all humans in the next six months,” according to the jobs page. \nThose who are willing to take the dive to work with CAAAC — the website urges all readers to bring their own wet gear — need only comment on the LinkedIn post announcing the center to automatically become a fellow. CAAAC also offers a generative AI tool to create your own AI center, complete with an executive director, in “less than a minute, zero AI knowledge required.” \nThe more ambitious job seeker applying to the “AI Alignment Alignment Alignment Researcher” position will, after clicking through the website, eventually find themselves serenaded by Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up.”",

They’re currently $143.98 ($86 off) at GameStop, dropping them to a new all-time low price. The Verge’s commerce editor, Cameron Faulkner, says they deliver excellent sound quality and versatility, with a USB-C audio transmitter that allows them to connect to everything from a PlayStation 5 to a Steam Deck and a Nintendo Switch 2.\nSony InZone Buds\nSony’s wireless gaming buds offer low latency, active noise cancellation, and support for both Bluetooth and USB-C.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229.99 $143.98 at GameStop\n $229.99 $198 at Best Buy\n\nSony’s InZone Buds offer many of the same features as the company’s flagship earbuds, the WF-1000XM5, which remain our favorite overall earbuds. They use the same drivers, and they borrow the XM5’s active noise cancellation and mic transparency capabilities. Additionally, they offer up to 12 hours of battery life on a single charge, or a total of 24 hours with the charging case (which can fit the USB-C transmitter).\nThe InZone Buds feature multiple sizes of silicone ear tips, and if you have a PC, Sony’s InZone app can perform a sound test to help you choose the right ear tip for your inner ear shape. If you struggle to find a comfortable fit, a feature like this can be seriously useful. The earbuds also include a microphone, plus touch gestures for muting the mic, adjusting the volume of your audio, and toggling between noise cancellation settings — all of which can be customized via the InZone app.\nOther deals worth checking out\nIf you’re looking for something to charge your phone, wireless earbuds, and smartwatch, the Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station is down to $65.99 ($45 off) at Amazon. The Qi2 charger features a tree-like design, with three different charging areas. The main charging pad delivers up to 15W to a phone, while a second charging pad can quickly replenish the Apple Watch. Meanwhile, the base features a pad for wireless earbuds. The 3-in-1 charging station comes with a 40W USB-C PD wall charger and a USB-C cable, so you won’t need to buy any additional accessories to start charging your devices.\nPreorders for the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Trilogy 4K release are now live, with a prelaunch discount of $70 ($30 off) at Amazon. The trilogy includes the original live-action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III. The first TMNT movie from 1990 is still the best one 35 years later, with turtle costumes from Jim Henson’s Creature Shop that still hold up. I remember watching it as a kid and being completely terrified by the building fire fight scene.\nThe Samsung Music Frame is currently down to an all-time low price of $127.99 ($260 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo. The 12.9 x 12.9-inch picture frame can connect to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi with support for surround sound when paired with one of Samsung’s new TVs or soundbars. It also boasts Dolby Atmos support for more immersive audio and a pair of woofers, tweeters, and midrange drivers. The Music Frame can be mounted on the wall or displayed on media furniture with a stand, and it can actually be customized with a physical photo, unlike the Sonos / Ikea Symfonisk frame speaker from a few years back.",
