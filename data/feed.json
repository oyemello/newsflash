      "raw": "Emma Roth is a news writer here at The Verge, “and for me,” she explains, “that means every day is different. During the four years I’ve been here, I’ve covered breaking news and written about basically everything in the realm of tech, whether it’s streaming price hikes, the latest in AI chatbots, privacy issues surrounding age verification, and a whole lot more.”\nAlthough she covers the latest tech news and products, it turns out that one of Emma’s favorite home appliances is a decades-old vacuum cleaner. I asked her about it.\nWhen (and why) did you get the vacuum cleaner? \nI purchased this Kenmore Progressive 116 vacuum for just $7 while browsing my local Savers thrift store several years ago. I was in need of a vacuum, and it instantly caught my eye because my parents used to have one just like it. I have fond childhood memories of going to Sears to pick up new vacuum bags.\nHow well does it work?\nDespite being around a couple of decades old, this thing works just as well as any new vacuum. It may not be cordless, bagless, or ultra lightweight, but it has impressive suction that can pick up anything from crumbs to more stubborn pet hair. (I don’t have any furry pets now, but growing up with several cats and dogs, this thing ripped.)\nIt also comes with a number of attachments, including a brush, crevice cleaner, and a hard floor tool. I use it in between my robovac’s cleanings, which unfortunately doesn’t pick up half as much as the Kenmore. It’s great for just about everything in the house, including rugs, tiled floors, on the couch, and cobwebby corners.\nIs there anything you don’t like about it, or that you’d improve if you could?\nAs you can see, this isn’t the prettiest-looking vacuum around — the white plastic has completely yellowed over the years. It can also be a pain to lug around the house. I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t violently yank the hose every so often to get this thing rolling around the house.\nEvery time I accidentally rip its plug out of the wall, I’m tempted to get a cordless Dyson. But I know it just wouldn’t be the same.\nIs there anything I should have asked that I didn’t?\nI just want to mention that I love the availability of replacement parts for this vacuum and just how straightforward it is to open up to clean the roller. Definitely a plus!",

      "raw": "There are a few caveats to the cellular and satellite connectivity, however.\t\n\nGarmin just announced its Fenix 8 Pro series of smartwatches, which adds both cellular and satellite connectivity via the company’s InReach tech. The Fenix 8 Pro series also adds a MicroLED display version that gets a maximum brightness of 4,500 nits. The catch is the watches will start at $1,199.99, with the MicroLED version going for an eye-watering $1,999.99.\nThe big news here is adding cellular and satellite connectivity means Fenix 8 Pro users won’t need to carry their phones. There are, however, a few caveats as Garmin will be utilizing LTE-M networks. According to its website, that means these watches will have “a data connection but not a phone number, and cannot make traditional voice calls or send SMS messages.” For those capabilities, you’ll have to either call other Fenix 8 Pro users or people who have downloaded the Garmin Messenger app, which was introduced last year. \nThat said, cellular connectivity does let you send 30-second voice messages via the Messenger app, allow users to send LiveTrack location sharing, and access real-time weather forecasts. Similarly, satellite connectivity will allow users to send and receive text messages via Garmin Messenger and location check-ins. SOS requests can be sent over both satellite and cellular via the Garmin Response center, which will then forward that information to emergency services, search and rescue organizations, and emergency contacts.\nAnd of course, cellular and satellite connectivity will require an active subscription, which will start at $7.99 per month. Garmin spokesperson Natalie Miller told The Verge that the InReach activation fee would be waived for Fenix 8 Pro owners, and there will be a free 30-day trial for first-time users. But LTE network access and satellite coverage aren’t available in all countries. (You can check where coverage is available here.)\nSmartwatch connectivity has been one area where Garmin has struggled to compete with competitors like the Apple Watch Ultra or Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra. While Garmin has the better reputation among athletes for durability, training features, and battery life, Apple and Samsung could offer phone-free experiences and safety assurances thanks to cellular. Garmin’s implementation here isn’t perfect, but it makes sense given the difficulty smaller companies experience when negotiating deals with carriers. This method relies mostly on Garmin’s existing InReach infrastructure and at least starts to address that gap. Previously, the only Garmin watches that offered any connectivity was the Forerunner 945 LTE, which was released in 2021, and its Bounce kids tracker.\nOn the hardware side of things, the Fenix 8 Pro series will come in two sizes: 47mm and 51mm. The OLED versions of the watches will get an estimated 27 days of battery life. The 47mm will cost $1,199.99 and the 51mm will cost $1,299.99. The $1,999.99 MicroLED version will only be available in the 51mm size, and will get up to 10 days of battery life. All three watches will be available starting September 8th.",

      "raw": "The UK’s larger energy supplier, Octopus Energy, is launching its own EV charger. The Octopus Charge is designed to pair with the Intelligent Octopus Go tariff, which offers up cheaper electricity rates overnight for EV charging.\nOctopus Energy has designed and built its own EV charger and is backing it with a three-year warranty. There’s a £999 (about $1,300) tethered option with a 5-meter cable or an £899 (around $1,200) untethered version you can use with any cable you want. Those prices are largely in line with other EV chargers once you factor in install costs, but the Octopus Charge will be tempting for Octopus customers as it’s installed and supported entirely by Octopus.\nOctopus has made a name for itself in the UK by using green energy to drive down the costs of electricity in the UK. Wholesale rates for electricity in the UK have soared in recent years, and Octopus offers variable pricing every 30 minutes on its Octopus Agile tariff or the Intelligent Octopus Go option that lets EV owners charge for 6 hours of cheap energy every night at 7p per kWh — that’s 9 cents per kWh. I’ve been using Octopus to get free electricity for a couple of years now.\nIf you’re not with Octopus then Octopus Charge isn’t as appealing, unless you’re willing to switch. While this EV charger looks like an easy way of locking Octopus customers in for life, if you do decide to leave the supplier it will be compatible with other energy suppliers in the UK. “Ideally this provider would have their own Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) platform to be able to directly control the charger,” explains Octopus spokesperson Christina Hofmann in an email to The Verge. “It’s also possible to switch the charger to Plug and Charge mode, with scheduling via the EV, in case the provider isn’t equipped their own OCPP platform.”\nThere are also plenty of other EV chargers that can integrate into the Intelligent Octopus Go tariff, but Octopus’ own version will make that integration a lot simpler and easy to use. Octopus controls third-party chargers through vehicle or EV charger APIs, which can occasionally be problematic.\nOctopus says its EV charger will be available for most EV drivers to purchase later this year, and the company is currently offering early access to those who lease a car through its Octopus Electric Vehicles scheme. Everyone else can register their interest at Octopus’ website.",

      "raw": "Have you ever wanted Windows 11 to automatically switch between light and dark modes based on a schedule, or help you find keyboard shortcut conflicts? Well, Microsoft is about to solve both of these missing Windows features with PowerToys.\nThe latest 0.94 release of PowerToys, the useful addons for Windows power users, includes a new shortcut conflicts feature that can detect what shortcuts are currently in use by Windows or PowerToys modules. There are so many PowerToys to choose from now that it’s easy to create a conflict and have two things happen at once when you activate a keyboard shortcut. Any conflicts will be highlighted in red in this conflicts tool, so you can reassign them quickly.\nMicrosoft is also working on addressing another big missing Windows 11 feature with a PowerToy module. “We are planning some nice new features and improvements for next month – a revamped Keyboard Manager UI, and a new utility that can automatically switch between light and dark mode based on your schedule,” says Niels Laute, a senior product manager at Microsoft.\nWhile you can manually enable light or dark modes in Windows 11, there’s no way to schedule these automatically based on your schedule or on sunrise and sunset times. It’s a basic feature that’s been part of iOS and Android for years, and I’m surprised Microsoft has had to create a PowerToy for this instead of this being natively part of Windows 11. Either way, it’s arriving next month so if you like to switch between themes on Windows 11 then you won’t have to do it manually anymore.\nIf you haven’t checked out PowerToys before there are plenty of other useful utilities like Advanced Paste, Always on Top, FancyZones, and the new Spotlight-like Command Palette launcher app. You can download the latest PowerToys release over on Microsoft’s GitHub page.",

      "raw": "The Paper Pro Move is similar in size to the iPad Mini but about an inch narrower. | Image: Remarkable\t\n\nA year after Remarkable introduced its Paper Pro digital notebook with an 11.8-inch color E Ink screen, the company is following up with a smaller version that prioritizes portability. The new Remarkable Paper Pro Move feels like what you’d be left with if you were to snap last year’s Paper Pro in half over your knee. With a 7.3-inch screen, it’s closer in size to a thin paperback novel you can easily slip into a pocket, but since the Paper Pro Move is as tall as the Paper Pro is wide, when turned sideways it provides a similar amount of writing real estate that shouldn’t feel cramped.\nThe new Paper Pro Move is available to order starting today for $449, which includes the company’s Marker stylus that charges while magnetically attached to the device. The Move is also available in a $499 bundle that includes Remarkable’s upgraded Marker Plus stylus with a built-in eraser button. The larger Remarkable Paper Pro will still be available for $629, so despite being less than half the size, the new Move is far from being less than half the price.\nAt 7.7 inches tall and 4.24 inches wide, the Paper Pro Move is similar in size to the 7th-gen iPad Mini but narrower by about an inch. It’s slightly thicker but less than half the weight of the original Paper Pro, and while both devices include 64GB of internal storage, the Paper Pro Move has a slower 1.7GHz dual core Cortex-A55 processor and a much smaller 2,334mAh battery which, according to the company, should keep the device powered for up to two weeks.\nAlthough companies like Amazon and Kobo continue to use E Ink’s Kaleido screen technology that generates colors using an added filter layer atop a black and white screen, the Paper Pro Move uses a 7.3-inch custom version of E Ink’s more advanced Gallery 3 panel that is also found in the Paper Pro. It’s capable of producing more vivid and accurate colors by mixing four shades of microscopic ink particles, but at the cost of noticeably slower refresh rates.\nDespite its size and more advanced color screen, the Paper Pro Move isn’t a replacement for color e-readers like the Kindle Colorsoft. It lacks access to online book stores, its document support is limited to PDFs and ePub files, and its front light is much dimmer than other E Ink devices. It’s still first and foremost a note-taking device with a large selection of templates such as day planners, the ability to convert handwritten notes into text for sharing over email, and the ability to annotate documents.\nRemarkable also plans to introduce new features to its devices starting with the Paper Pro Move, including the option to reposition the on-screen toolbar that provides quick access to different pen types and writing tools, and the ability to search handwritten documents. However, while features like handwriting conversion, third-party cloud storage options, and accessing notes in Remarkable’s mobile app are all included, more advanced features, including editing notes in the mobile apps, sharing to Slack, and searching handwritten documents, will only be available as part of a $2.99/month subscription to Remarkable’s Connect service after a 100-day free trial.",

The launch includes the new $1,099 PartyBox 720,  which is JBL’s largest battery-powered speaker to date, weighing 7 pounds (3kg) more than the visually similar PartyBox 710 that was released in 2021.\nThe PartyBox 720 measures 16.4 x 37.1 x 16 inches, compared to 15.7 x 35.6 x 17.2 inches for the smaller 710, and expands the two 8-inch subwoofers to 9 inches. Unlike the 710, the 720 can also run on battery power, so users don’t need to hunt for an outlet. It comes with two of JBL’s rechargeable 600 batteries, which provide up to 15 hours of playtime, according to the company’s press release.\nAside from the larger dimensions and battery support, both party speakers have similar features — both provide 800 watts of power, customizable lights, an IPX4 resistance to splashing water, and they include built-in wheels and a carry handle to pull them around despite the additional weight.\nJBL is also launching the $550 Boombox 4 and the more portable $100 Grip — the latter being a new JBL product line that resembles its colorful Flip series, but with customizable ambient lighting built in. Both the Boombox 4 and Grip speakers feature an IP68 rating, making them “waterproof, dustproof, and drop-proof,” according to JBL.\nAll three speakers are available to preorder now. The PartyBox 720 is expected to be available at in-store retailers on September 21st, with the Grip and Boombox 4 arriving later on September 28th.",
