      "raw": "A before and after image of a bedroom changed using Zillow’s Virtual Staging tool.\t\n\nZillow is launching an AI-powered feature that will allow home hunters to empty the room of furniture or subtly change the design style. The intent is to make it easier to overcome the owner’s dodgy design choices and questionable furniture so buyers can better picture themselves living in a property.\nIn concept, the tool, called Virtual Staging, is great. It tackles a genuine and difficult problem that almost anyone who has searched for a home at some point has encountered. “Too many buyers overlook what could be the perfect home for their family simply because they can’t see past the furniture or design choices,” says Zillow home trends expert Amanda Pendleton.\nUnfortunately, Virtual Staging is rather basic in this phase of the rollout. The lackluster changes are so subtle — adjusting a bit of furniture here, changing the color of a rug there — you’d have trouble knowing anything had changed without the telltale sparkles of AI or the ability to slide back and forth between preselected styles like modern, Scandinavian, luxury and farmhouse.\nZillow says the feature is a “smarter way to shop” and sell, joining an AI search feature it upgraded last year to help shoppers find homes. Its use will be limited to premium “Showcase” listings, and even then it’s only on “select featured room photos.” All the examples seem limited to plain white walls, as well.",

      "raw": "It’s less noticeable than a thinner profile or trick camera lenses, but Apple is pointing out another upgrade in the iPhone 17 family of phones that it says is part of “the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.” Explicitly targeting the spyware industry that produces exploits for tools like Pegasus to hack on targeted devices, a series of changes in Apple’s chips, OS, and development tools are part of what it calls Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE).\nWith the introduction of the iPhone 17 lineup and iPhone Air, we’re excited to deliver Memory Integrity Enforcement: the industry’s first ever, comprehensive, always-on memory-safety protection covering key attack surfaces — including the kernel and over 70 userland processes — built on the Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) and supported by secure typed allocators and tag confidentiality protections.\nThe approach is similar to what we’ve seen from Microsoft’s introduction of memory integrity security features for Windows 11, as well as a series of changes that have arrived to prevent speculative-execution vulnerabilities like Spectre. Apple’s blog post also mentions efforts by ARM with the Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to fight memory bugs, which is supported on Google’s Pixel phones starting with the Pixel 8 series and enabled for supported apps if you turn on Advanced Protection. \n\n\n🔺iPhone models announced today include Memory Integrity Enforcement, the culmination of an unprecedented design and engineering effort that we believe represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems. https://t.co/ule9gaXzc1\n— Ivan Krstić (@radian) September 9, 2025\n\n\nApple says its implementation goes a step further, with the ability to protect all users by default and by designing its A19 and A19 Pro chips for enhanced security, while still adding memory safety changes for older hardware that doesn’t support the new memory tagging features. The company also says its new mitigation for Spectre V1 leaks works with “virtually zero CPU cost” — as performance hits have been an issue for memory integrity and other security features — with all of the changes making “mercenary spyware” even more expensive to develop. \nThe folks behind the security-focused GrapheneOS project acknowledged the “major security improvements” that will help iPhone security in a post on X, but also said they had issues with the presentation and how it portrayed iOS security versus features like MTE, already released for Android. We’ll learn more about how much has changed once these updates reach devices and attackers take their turn trying to crack open the iPhone 17 and iPhone Air’s security.",

(The feature is still free for two years after activation on iPhone 14 models and newer.) But in 2023, Apple added an additional free year for existing iPhone 14 users, meaning that the deadline to potentially start paying for the earliest adopters would be November 2025. Now, it appears that deadline has been bumped to November 2026.\nWith iOS 18 last year, Apple expanded its satellite messaging features to let you text friends or family when you’re off the grid.

      "raw": "Anthropic’s $1.5 billion book piracy settlement has been put on pause after the federal judge overseeing the class action case raised concerns about the terms of the agreement. During a hearing this week, Judge William Alsup rejected the settlement over concerns that class action lawyers will create a deal behind closed doors that they will force “down the throats of authors,” according to reports from Bloomberg Law and the Associated Press.\nAnthropic agreed to pay the landmark settlement last week, putting to rest a class action lawsuit from US authors that accused the AI company of training its models on hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books. Judge Alsup let the class action lawsuit move forward after ruling that Anthropic training its AI models on purchased books counts as fair use, but that it could be liable for training on illegally downloaded work.\nIn addition to his concerns over authors being strong-armed into signing a deal, Alsup says he needs to review more information about the claims process outlined in the settlement. “I have an uneasy feeling about hangers on with all this money on the table,” Alsup said, as reported by Bloomberg Law.\nUnder the settlement, authors and publishers would receive about $3,000 for covered works. As noted by AP, an attorney for the authors said there are around 465,000 books that would be covered by the settlement, but Judge Alsup asked for a solid number to ensure Anthropic doesn’t get hit with other lawsuits “coming out of the woodwork.” He added that class members will need to be given “very good notice” to make sure they’re aware of the case.\nMaria Pallante, CEO of the Association of American Publishers, an industry group backing the authors’ lawsuit, told AP that Alsup “demonstrated a lack of understanding of how the publishing industry works.” Pallante said that “class actions are supposed to resolve cases, not create new disputes, and certainly not between the class members who were harmed in the first place.” The authors’ attorney, Justin Nelson, said in a statement to Bloomberg Law that the lawyers “care deeply that every single proper claim gets compensation.”\nJudge Alsup will revisit the settlement during another hearing on September 25th. “We’ll see if I can hold my nose and approve it,” Alsup said, according to the AP.",

Apple says it expects clearance from the FDA and other regulators this month. It will roll out in more than 150 countries and regions.\nAdditionally, Apple’s upcoming Sleep Score feature is coming to a wider selection of watches beyond the new Watch Series 11. Next week, it will roll out to the Watch Series 6 and later, in addition to all Watch Ultra models and the second-gen Watch SE and later. This feature uses your heart rate, wrist temperature, blood oxygen, and respiratory data to rate the quality of your sleep when used with an iPhone 11 or later.\nThese features will arrive with watchOS 26 on September 15th.",

      "raw": "The Apple Watch SE 3 starts at $249 and is available for preorder today. | Image: Apple\t\n\nThe iPhone Air and the iPhone 17 fleet of phones took the spotlight during Apple’s “Awe dropping” event. If you weren’t tempted by the new phones, the fact that the entire Apple Watch lineup got refreshed might have been even bigger news to you. Soon, the Apple Watch SE 3, Apple Watch Series 11, and Apple Watch Ultra 3 will arrive, and each is bringing along some big upgrades, which we’ll get into a bit below.\nAll three are available for preorder starting today, with the SE 3 starting at $249, the Series 11 starting at $399, and the Ultra 3 starting at $799. They’ll all ship on September 19th. We’ll update this post if any attractive carrier deals roll in.\nAll three watches launch with watchOS 26, which includes the new Liquid Glass design, just like the new updates coming to most of Apple’s other devices on September 15th. The update also includes an AI-powered Workout Buddy to encourage you during exercise. Flicking your wrist up will clear your notifications. The watchOS 26 update will be released for older Apple Watch models (going back to Series 6, SE 2, and Ultra) on September 15th.\nWe’ve gone hands-on with the upcoming Apple Watches — delivering impressions to the extent that it’s possible in a limited hands-on environment — but we’ll soon be getting each of them in for a full review. We also have initial impressions of the iPhone 17 line, including the iPhone 17, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, and the iPhone Air.\nWhere to preorder the Apple Watch SE 3\nThe Apple Watch SE 3 is the first update to Apple’s entry-level smartwatch line since 2022. It has the same S10 chip as the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3, and an always-on display that Apple says is four times more scratch resistant than the previous model. It supports Apple’s SOS and fall-detection features, plus an entirely new feature called Sleep Score, which analyzes the amount of time you spend in each sleep stage and gives you a score based on the overall quality of sleep. The Apple Watch SE 3 also supports sleep apnea detection.\nApple says the SE 3’s charging speed is twice as fast as the previous Apple Watch SE, offering eight hours of battery life off a 15 minute charge. The cellular version of the Apple Watch SE 3 supports 5G for the first time. When you’re not connected to the internet, you can use on-device Siri to handle local requests.\nThe Apple Watch SE 3 is available in two case sizes: 42mm and 44mm. The 42mm GPS model costs $249, and jumps up to $299 if you want cellular connectivity. The 44mm GPS model costs $299, and the cellular model costs $329. All models are available for preorder from Apple, and you can choose your size, color, and whether you want the GPS or cellular version from the same page.\nApple Watch SE 3 (GPS; 42mm)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Apple\n\nWhere to preorder the Apple Watch Series 11\nThe Apple Watch Series 11 may look the same as the Series 10 it’s replacing, but it has a 5G cellular modem for the first time. Its displays are the same size, but Apple says the glass it used is twice as scratch resistant. Its heart rate sensor can now measure how blood is flowing through your veins to detect hypertension in the background, a feature that’s currently waiting for clearance at the FDA. That feature is also going to be available on the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. It also supports the new Sleep Score feature. The Series 11’s battery life has been bumped to 24 hours, up from 18 hours.\nThe Apple Watch Series 11 comes in two sizes: 42mm and 46mm. The 42mm GPS model costs $399, while the cellular version will set you back $499. The 46mm version costs $429, or $529 if you want the cellular model. All models are available for preorder from Apple, and you can choose your size, color, band type, and whether you want the GPS or cellular version from the same page.\nApple Watch Series 11 (42mm; GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399 at Apple\n\nWhere to preorder the Apple Watch Ultra 3\nThe refreshed Apple Watch Ultra 3 has a larger wide-angle OLED display that can ratchet its refresh rate down to 1Hz for a more responsive always-on display. The smartwatch’s case size hasn’t changed, but the display is slightly larger thanks to a reduction in bezel size. It lasts up to 48 hours per charge, and has the same new 5G modem as the rest of Apple’s upcoming smartwatches. It’s also gained support for satellite texting, which will allow you to send a message and enable Find My to share your location when Wi-Fi and cellular service aren’t available.\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 3 is available in one case size, 49mm, and you can preorder it from Apple for $799. \nApple Watch Ultra 3\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 at Apple\n\nCorrection, September 9th: An earlier version of this article misstated two Apple Watch Series 11 prices. The 42mm cellular version costs $499, not $429; the base 46mm version costs $429, not $499.",

      "raw": "The new iPhone Air starts at $999. | Image: The Verge\t\n\nApple announced its new iPhone 17 lineup during its “Awe dropping” event on Tuesday. As expected, the company introduced the iPhone 17, the flagship iPhone 17 Pro, and a bigger iPhone 17 Pro Max. There’s also a new addition to the lineup this year: the slimmed-down iPhone Air, which features a 6.5-inch ProMotion display and measures at just 5.6mm thick.\nBeyond the Air’s slimmer design, Apple’s latest iPhone lineup features a number of notable updates. The standard iPhone 17 now features a larger 6.3-inch display with ProMotion and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Meanwhile, the Pro model has returned to an aluminum build while adding the biggest battery of any iPhone yet. The iPhone Air and Pro models have a lot in common, including having a “plateau” bump on the back, which Apple says creates additional space for internal components, like a larger battery.\nThe iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and Air start at $799, $1,099, $1,199, and $999, respectively, with preorders beginning Friday, September 12th, and shipments set to arrive the following Friday, September 19th. Below, you’ll find more information about each new device, along with where you can place a preorder. We’ll update this post as carrier promotions roll in.\nWhere to preorder the iPhone Air\nThe iPhone Air finally made its debut after months of rumors. It’s Apple’s thinnest iPhone ever at 5.6mm thick, and features a 6.5-inch ProMotion display and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Apple says the design is its “most durable” yet, with a ceramic shield that encloses a titanium frame on both sides (also found in the iPhone 17 Pro). The device also sports a single 48MP fusion camera, along with an A19 Pro processor and Apple’s in-house C1X modem. Despite its thinner design, Apple says the Air features “all-day battery life,” with up to 27 hours of video playback, or 40 hours when the $99 iPhone Air MagSafe battery is attached.\nYou’ll be able to preorder the iPhone Air at Apple alongside the other models on Friday, September 12th, with the launch set to follow on Friday, September 19th. The Air starts at $999 with 256GB of storage, and goes all the way up to $1,399 for the 1TB model.\niPhone Air\nThe iPhone Air is Apple’s thinnest iPhone yet at 5.6mm, featuring a 6.5-inch ProMotion display, a 48MP fusion camera, and an 18MP front camera with Center Stage support. It also boasts the most Apple-designed chips in an iPhone: the A19 Pro, N1, and C1X.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 at Apple (256GB)\n $1199 at Apple (512GB)\n $1399 at Apple (1TB)\n\nWhere to preorder the iPhone 17\nThe iPhone 17 is Apple’s latest entry-level smartphone. Like last year’s release, it borrows many of its best features from the previous-generation Pro line, including a larger 6.3-inch 120Hz ProMotion display. The device also features a new A19 processor and a dual 48MP fusion camera system that has a main camera and an ultrawide camera. A new 18MP Center Stage front camera features a square sensor, allowing users to take high-quality landscape-mode selfies without having to rotate their phone.\nThe phone is available in five colors (black, lavender, mist blue, sage, and white) and features a starting storage of 256GB. The iPhone 17 is set to launch on Friday, September 19th, with preorders beginning Friday, September 12th at Apple for $799 with 256GB of storage or $999 with 512GB of storage.\niPhone 17\nThe standard iPhone 17 has a 6.3-inch ProMotion display that can reach 3,000 nits of peak brightness, an A19 chip, and a 48MP dual camera system. It also features an 18MP Center Stage selfie camera with a square sensor, allowing users to take landscape selfies while holding the device vertically. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 at Apple (256GB)\n $999 at Apple (512GB)\n\nWhere to preorder the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max look different than last year’s Pro models. While they keep the same 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays, respectively, Apple has made a few tweaks to the design. One of the first things you’ll probably notice is the plateau camera bump on the back, which houses a trio of 48MP fusion cameras. Both devices also boast an upgraded 18MP selfie camera with support for Center Stage, and a more powerful A19 Pro processor inside. The Pro models feature larger batteries than before, too, with the 17 Pro Max delivering the best battery life ever in an iPhone, according to Apple.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max launch alongside the non-Pro models on Friday, September 19th. The smaller Pro starts at $1,099 with 256GB of storage, while the 17 Pro Max starts at $1,199 with 256GB of storage, with preorders beginning Friday, September 12th. For the first time ever, Apple is offering a 2TB configuration of the 17 Pro Max for $1,999. You can nab a preorder for the 17 Pro from Apple; the 17 Pro Max is also available for preorder at Apple.\niPhone 17 Pro\nThe iPhone 17 Pro features a 6.3-inch OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, and it’s powered by an A19 Pro chip. It features a 48MP triple camera system, plus a new “plateau” bar on the back, which Apple says creates additional space for internal components, including a larger battery.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1099 at Apple (256GB)\n $1299 at Apple (512GB)\n $1499 at Apple (1TB)\n\n\niPhone 17 Pro Max\nThe larger iPhone 17 Pro Max sports a 6.9-inch OLED screen and the best battery life ever in an iPhone. It has most of the same features as the smaller iPhone 17 Pro, though, but offers storage up to 2TB — a first in the iPhone line.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199 at Apple (256GB)\n $1399 at Apple (512GB)\n $1999 at Apple (2TB)",
