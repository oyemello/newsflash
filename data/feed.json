      "raw": "You can get a great budget device these days if you know how to pick your priorities. | Image: The Verge\t\n\nSome of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets. They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.\nBudget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever. You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world.\nWhat compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.\n\nThe best cheap iPhone\nThe best Android phone under $500\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nOther budget phones to consider\n\nThe best cheap iPhone\niPhone 16E\nThe iPhone 16E is the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, bringing flagship-level performance for less than the standard 16. We really wish it included MagSafe for $599, but those upgrading from older iPhones will probably be satisfied with what’s included.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nReliable performance\nGood, if limited, camera system\nIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy\n\nNo MagSafe\n$599 feels like $100 too much\nNo ultrawide\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 at Apple\n $599.99 at Best Buy\n $599.99 at Verizon\n\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nIf I were making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly cheap. If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.\nThere’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.\nAnother heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming and the most interesting bits won’t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.\nRead my full iPhone 16E review.\nThe best Android phone under $500\nGoogle Pixel 9A\nThe Pixel 9A adds more robust water resistance and a brighter, bigger screen to what was already a winning formula for a good midrange phone.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nRobust IP68 rating\nSeven years of software updates\nBrighter, bigger screen\n\nMissing a couple of AI features\nAI is occasionally handy, usually weird\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 at Amazon\n $499 at Best Buy\n $499.99 at Google\n\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nGoogle’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right. \nThe phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also received a slight boost to IP68, which means it can withstand a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.\nThe 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A’s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin.\nRead my full Google Pixel 9A review.\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nOnePlus 13R\nThe OnePlus 13R is a pared-down version of the company’s flagship phone, and it offers excellent battery life and a great screen for the price.\n\n\nScore: 6\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent battery life\nGreat screen for the price\nSix years of security updates\n\nNo wireless charging\nOnly splash-resistant\nFewer OS updates than Google and Samsung\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599.99 $555.99 at Amazon\n $599.99 at Best Buy\n $599.99 at OnePlus\n\nScreen: 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP65\nThe OnePlus 13R isn’t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It’s also a little pricier at $599 — although we’ve seen it on sale for $499 for extended periods of time — but for some people, the 13R’s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best big screens in its class, and many people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you’re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.\nThere’s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won’t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against sprays and rain showers, but it isn’t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won’t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience, especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A.\nRead my full OnePlus 13R review.\nOther budget phones to consider\nThe 2025 Motorola Moto G Power offers a lot despite its starting price of $299.99. It features a 6.8-inch LCD display, a 5,000mAh battery, wireless charging support, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is increasingly rare in 2025. Additionally, the device combines both IP68 and IP69 ratings, meaning it’s rated for both submersion in water and exposure to high-pressure water jets and steam, in addition to full protection from dust.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is another perfectly capable phone that doesn’t quite earn a recommendation here. It’s a little outside the scope of this guide at $649 anyway, but you do get a telephoto lens and a nice, big screen for that price. Still, you’re better off saving a bunch and picking up the Pixel 9A or trying to score a trade-in promo for the newer Galaxy S25. Read our review.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A56 recently launched in the US with a starting price of $499. The device has all the makings of a solid midrange phone, including a 6.7-inch OLED display, a 50-megapixel main camera, an Exynos 1580 chip, and a 5,000mAh battery with 45W wired charging. Although we haven’t tested it yet, it has some pretty stiff competition in the form of the Pixel 9A, which also has a starting price of $499.\nWe got our first glimpse of the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G back at CES 2025. The device features an Nxtpaper matte LCD screen that’s supposed to be easier on your eyes than a traditional LCD, as it reduces your exposure to blue light. It also features a “Max Ink Mode,” which turns the screen monochrome and silences notifications. This, in turn, can help extend the phone’s battery life to multiple days. Read our initial impressions.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A36 5G is another great choice that recently launched in the US for $399.99. The device sports a big OLED display, a decent midrange Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor, and an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance. Samsung is promising six years of OS and security updates, which is a lot in this price range. Compared to the Galaxy A35 5G, which we previously included in this guide but is no longer available, the A36 5G drops the microSD slot for a second SIM card slot. While we haven’t tested the A36 5G, its predecessor offered a good balance of hardware and price, and the latest release sounds just as compelling.\nUpdate, September 8th: Updated pricing / availability.

      "raw": "Google made three major updates to its Gemini-powered products on Monday: The Gemini app now accepts audio files; Search can handle five new languages; and NotebookLM creates reports in the form of blog posts, study guides, quizzes, and more. \nAccording to a Monday post on X by Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and Gemini, audio file compatibility was the “#1 request” to the Gemini app. \nFree Gemini users max out at 10 minutes of audio, and five free prompts each day. AI Pro or AI Ultra users, meanwhile, can upload audio up to three hours in length. All Gemini prompts accommodate up to 10 files across various file formats, including within ZIP files. \nAdditionally, Google Search’s AI Mode has rolled out five new language options: Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese, thanks to the integration of Gemini 2.5 with Search, according to a company blog: “With this expansion, more people can now use AI Mode to ask complex questions in their preferred language, while exploring the web more deeply.” \nThe Gemini-powered NotebookLM software is also getting an update in the form of new report styles in over 80 languages based on a user’s uploaded documents, files, and other media. \n(While the Gemini app is just now getting audio, NotebookLM already had that capability, positioning itself as a research tool that helps find patterns in files of different formats.)\nThe standard report formats include study guides, briefing docs, and blog posts. Flashcards and quizzes are also included in the latest NotebookLM update. Users can choose the self-created format and adjust the structure, tone, and style of the report. The feature “should be 100%” available by the end of this week, according to a company comment to a post on X.\nGoogle has been on a dizzying spree of AI-related features in the past month. Gemini began automatically recalling user details and preferences from past conversations in August, the same month that free users gained access to Workspace’s video generation software Vids. In September, Photos upgraded to the latest video generation software Veo 3 and gave free users the ability to create silent 4-second long videos from their own personal, still pictures.",

On that free tier, you’ll also be able to save your text messages past then, and while you’ll be limited to saving 100MB of messages, Signal expects that will still “be large enough for even heavy Signal users to back up the text of all of their messages,” according to O’Leary.\nThe backup archives are “stored without a direct link to a specific backup payment or Signal user account,” O’Leary says. You’ll use a recovery key to unlock your backups, but if you lose that key, the company “cannot help you recover it.” If you turn on secure backups, your device will make a new backup every day.\nThe feature is available on Android’s beta app, and a public launch and iOS and desktop support are “coming soon.” Down the line, Signal plans to let users save a secure backup archive to “the location of your choosing.”",

      "raw": "It’s been five years since Polestar first introduced the Precept, a concept car that the electric automaker described as “a manifesto of things to come; a declaration.” Well, come they have, because today Polestar finally revealed the production car that’s based on this manifesto: the Polestar 5.\nAnd wow, these specs: up to 460 miles of range, 800-volt architecture for ultra-fast charging, 884 horsepower, 0–60mph in an oomph-inducing 3.1 seconds for the Performance trim. It certainly makes those five years feel like worth the wait.\nIn final form, the Polestar 5 is an absolutely stunning fastback sedan with dramatic proportions that are sized similarly to the Porsche Panamera. The 5 will be built on a bespoke supercar-like bonded aluminum platform that’s was developed at Polestar’s own facility in England. And like the Polestar 4, it lacks a rear window, relying instead on a high-definition rearview camera.\nThere’s a lot more, so let’s dig into it. \nPower\nAt launch, there will be two versions of the Polestar 5: a Dual Motor trim with 748hp (550kW), 599lb-ft of torque (812 Newton-meters), and a 0–60mph time of 3.8 seconds; and a Performance package with 884hp (650kW), 749lb-ft (1,015Nm) of torque, and 0–60mph acceleration in 3.1 seconds. Both versions are speed-limited to a maximum of 155mph — seemingly in the spirit of former parent company Volvo’s safety maxim of limiting vehicle max speed to 112mph.\nThe 800-volt architecture is new to Polestar, and should enable 350kW charging when plugged into a suitable charger. That means 10–80 percent charging in “as little” as 22 minutes, the company says. Owners can expect a WLTP estimated range of 670km (416 miles) for the Dual Motor trim and 565km (351 miles) for the Performance one.\nThe Polestar 5’s battery contains 112kWh of energy, 106kWh of which is usable. The SK One-supplied NMC (nickel cobalt manganese) pack consists of eight modules with 192 cells. And its design forms part of the 5’s steel structure, which Polestar says brings safety benefits.\nDesign\nThe Polestar 5 is built on the company’s Polestar Performance Architecture (PPA), which uses a bespoke, hot-cured aluminum structure for improved weight and rigidity. That frame consists of 13 percent recycled aluminum and 83 percent aluminum from smelters (no word on the remaining 4 percent), which helps lower the 5’s carbon footprint when compared to standard sourcing.\n(Keep in mind that Polestar has positioned itself as one of the few automotive startups that still gives a shit about climate change. The company’s CEO recently used his keynote at the IAA Mobility conference in Munich, where the Polestar 5 will make its debut, to urge EU leaders to stick to their strict zero-emission goals.)\nThe Performance variant is slated to have a sport-tuned suspension with semi-active dampers. There are also bespoke Michelin tires, designed specifically for the Polestar 5, ranging from 20 to 22 inches depending on the trim level.\nInside, you’ll find a 14.5-inch portrait display alongside a 9-inch instrument cluster behind the steering wheel. To cut down on distractions, there will be a 9.5-inch heads-up display projected on the windshield. And a driver-monitoring camera makes sure the driver keeps their eyes on the road while the driver assist system is engaged.\n\nThe Performance variant is slated to have a sport-tuned suspension with semi-active dampers.\n\n\nThe front fascia features Polestar’s SmartZone, which consists of many of the vehicles’ sensors, like radar and the front parking camera. In total, the Polestar 5 has 11 vision cameras, one driver monitoring camera, one mid-range radar, and 12 ultrasonic sensors. (Unlike the Polestar 3 and 4, the 5 won’t feature a lidar sensor.) The vehicle also uses interior radars to detect the number, position, and type of occupants to “deploy the correct safety measures in the event of an accident.”\nThere’s a lot of high-end brand names scattered throughout this announcement: Brembo for braking, Bowers & Wilkins for a premium audio system, and Bridge of Weir nappa leather as an optional interior. The driver-assist system is powered by Mobileye, while the infotainment system runs on Google’s embedded Android software.\nWhile designed as a four-seater, the rear arm rest can be lifted to accommodate a fifth passenger. Polestar cut out a space in the battery, known as the foot garage, behind the front seats to give occupants an extra foot of space for a more natural seating position.\nAvailability\nPolestar didn’t reveal an exact launch date — customer deliveries are planned for the first half of 2026 — or starting price for the 5, only to say they are coming soon. Suffice it to say it won’t be cheap. The Performance version of the grand tourer is expected to start somewhere north of $100,000 in North America.\nThe company has had a strong sales year so far, thanks to some deep discounts, including one geared toward converting former Tesla owners. The company makes the Polestar 2 electric fastback, the Polestar 3 electric SUV, and the Polestar 4 electric SUV coupe. \nTariffs are sure to take a toll on the Geely-owned, Swedish-designed company’s future. Polestar manufactures in the US and China, and plans to make the Polestar 4 in South Korea in the second half of 2025. It hasn’t said where the 5 will be built, so that will be one to watch. \nBut despite these challenges, Polestar is charging ahead. First shown last spring as the O2 concept, the Polestar 6 will be the brand’s next flagship model, taking the form of a two-door sports car with a convertible roof. And when the 6 goes on sale (presumably in 2026), it will use the same architecture and powertrains as the Polestar 5.",

      "raw": "An old screenshot of Nova Launcher. | Image: Nova Launcher\t\n\nAfter nearly everyone working on the Nova Launcher, one of the most recognizable names in Android launchers, was laid off last year, founder Kevin Barry, Nova’s sole remaining developer, said this weekend that he has left Nova’s parent company after being asked to stop working on the launcher and an effort to open-source it. Nova Launcher’s website currently shows a 404 error, though the launcher is still available on Google Play.\nMobile analytics company Branch Metrics acquired Nova in 2022. The company’s CEO at the time, co-founder Alex Austin, said on Reddit that if Barry were to leave Branch, “it’s contracted that the code will be open-sourced and put in the hands of the community.” Austin left Branch in 2023, and now with Barry officially gone from the company, too, it’s unclear if the launcher will now actually be open-sourced.\nBarry declined to comment to The Verge. We’ve reached out to Branch for comment.\n“I think the newer leadership since Alex Austin left has put a different focus on the company and Nova simply isn’t part of that focus in any way at all,” Cliff Wade, Nova’s former customer relations lead who left as part of the 2024 layoffs, tells The Verge. “It’s just some app that they own but no longer feel they need or want.”\nWade also said that “I don’t believe Branch will do the right thing any time soon with regards to open-sourcing Nova. I think they simply just don’t care and don’t want to invest time, unless of course, they get enough pressure from the community and individuals who care.” Users have started a change.org petition to ask for the project to be open-sourced, and Wade says it’s a “great start” to apply that pressure. Wade said he hasn’t personally seen Barry’s contract, so couldn’t corroborate the claim of a contractual obligation to open-source Nova.\nStill, he said that the community “deserves” for the launcher to be open-sourced. “Branch just simply needs to do the right thing here and honor what they as a company have stated as well as what then CEO Alex Austin has stated numerous times prior to him leaving Branch.”\nAdditional reporting by Dominic Preston.",

      "raw": "For months, Google has maintained that the web is “thriving,” AI isn’t tanking traffic, and its search engine is sending people to a wider variety of websites than ever. But in a court filing from last week, Google admitted that “the open web is already in rapid decline,” as spotted earlier by Jason Kint and reported on by Search Engine Roundtable.\nGoogle submitted the filing ahead of another trial that will determine how it will address its monopoly in the advertising technology business. The US Department of Justice recommends that Google break up its advertising business, but the company argues in the filing that this isn’t ideal because it would “only accelerate” the decline of the open web, “harming publishers who currently rely on open-web display advertising revenue.”\nGoogle:\nFinally, while Plaintiffs continue to advance essentially the same divestiture remedies they noticed in their complaint filed in January 2023, the world has continued to turn. Plaintiffs put forth remedies as if trial, the Court’s liability decision, and remedies discovery never happened—and also as if the incredibly dynamic ad tech ecosystem had stood still while these judicial proceedings continued. \nBut the changes have been many: AI is reshaping ad tech at every level; non-open web display ad formats like Connected TV and retail media are exploding in popularity; and Google’s competitors are directing their investments to these new growth areas. The fact is that today, the open web is already in rapid decline and Plaintiffs’ divestiture proposal would only accelerate that decline, harming publishers who currently rely on open-web display advertising revenue. As the law makes clear, the last thing a court should do is intervene to reshape an industry that is already in the midst of being reshaped by market forces.\nThe statement sharply contrasts Google’s recent narrative about the health of search on the web. Google has a clear incentive to make itself appear weaker or less monopolistic in the courtroom, but its admission reflects a reality many publishers are going through. Several digital publishers and independent website owners have reported experiencing a decline in traffic following changes to Google Search’s algorithm and the rise of AI chatbots. \nIn an emailed statement to The Verge, Google spokesperson Jackie Berté said the statement is “one cherry-picked line that misrepresents” the company’s legal filing. “It’s clear from the preceding sentence that we’re referring to ‘open-web display advertising’ and not the open web as a whole,” Berté said. “We are pointing out the obvious: that investments in non-open web display advertising like connected TV and retail media are growing at the expense of those in open web display advertising.”\nWhen asked about changes to web traffic during an episode of Decoder in May, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is “definitely sending traffic to a wider range of sources and publishers” following the rollout of AI search tools.\nNick Fox, Google’s senior vice president of knowledge, similarly defended Google against claims that changes to search are impacting web traffic. “From our point of view, the web is thriving,” Fox said on an episode of the AI Inside podcast. In the wake of a report from Pew Research, which said people are “less likely” to click on links when presented with Google’s AI Overview, Google Search head Liz Reid claimed that click volume has remained “relatively stable” when compared to the same time last year, adding that Google continues to “send billions of clicks to websites every day.”\nView Link\nUpdate, September 8th: Added a statement from Google.",

The new whistleblowers are being represented by legal nonprofit Whistleblower Aid, which also worked with Haugen. \nIn a statement, Meta spokesperson Dani Lever said the allegation its legal team sidelined research is based on a few examples “stitched together to fit a predetermined and false narrative; in reality since the start of 2022, Meta has approved nearly 180 Reality Labs-related studies on social issues, including youth safety and well-being.” Lever said Meta research has led to “significant product updates” including parent supervision tools, and that its VR devices are made for people over 13.\nThe allegations are expected to take center stage at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday called “Hidden Harms: Examining Whistleblower Allegations that Meta Buried Child Safety Research.” Three Republicans on that committee have already asked Meta for more information on its protections for kids and teens on its Horizon Worlds virtual platform. \nAlso on Monday, the former head of security at Meta-owned WhatsApp filed a lawsuit accusing the company of ignoring privacy and security issues that allegedly endangered users’ information, The New York Times reported. WhatsApp spokesperson Carl Woog called the lawsuit “a familiar playbook in which a former employee is dismissed for poor performance and then goes public with distorted claims that misrepresent the ongoing hard work of our team.”\nUpdate, September 8th: Added information about the WhatsApp lawsuit.",

      "raw": "With a smart video doorbell, your front door’s communication skills go from 1980s landline to a modern smartphone. Combining a motion-activated camera with a microphone, speaker, and buzzer, a doorbell camera sends alerts to your phone, allowing you to see who’s at the door without needing to open it or even be at home. Whether you’re curled up on the couch, hard at work in your office, or sunning on a beach in the Bahamas, a video doorbell keeps you in touch with what’s happening on your doorstep.\nI’ve tested more than 35 video doorbells, and while there’s no one-size-fits-all, like a smartphone, it’s a personal choice, I have thoughts on which are the best of the best and which work well for specific use cases.\nMy top advice is to use the existing doorbell wires if you have them. Wired doorbells are generally cheaper, work better, and are more compact, so they tend to look nicer.\nIf you don’t have wires and don’t want to pay for an electrician to run them, try using an AC power adapter (Ring and Google Nest sell their own; you can also find generic ones). But if all else fails, I’ve got recommendations for good battery-powered buzzers. Just plan to pick up an extra battery when you purchase, or factor in removing it from your door every few months to charge it for a few hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest doorbell camera\nBest battery-powered doorbell camera\nBest budget doorbell camera\nBest doorbell camera without a subscription\nBest wired video doorbell that works with Amazon Alexa and Ring\nA great wired doorbell camera for Ecobee users\nBest video doorbell camera for Apple HomeKit Secure Video\nBest video doorbell door lock\nOther doorbell cameras I tested\nDoorbell cameras I plan to test\nWhat’s coming next?\n\nBest doorbell camera\nNest Doorbell (wired)\nWith 24/7 recording, facial recognition, reliable smart alerts, and some free video recording, Google’s wired doorbell is the best option for most people. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 at Google\n $179.99 at Best Buy\n $179.99 at Lowe’s\n\nVideo quality: 960 x 1280p, 6x zoom, HDR / Smart alerts: Person, package, animal, vehicle, and facial recognition ($) Aspect ratio: 3:4 / Field of view: 145 degrees diagonal / Power options: Wired / Wi-Fi: 2.4GHz and 5GHz / Storage: Cloud and local / Subscription fee: $10 a month / Works with: Alexa, Google, SmartThings\nThe Nest Doorbell Wired (2nd-gen) is one of only two video doorbells in this list that can record 24/7. Scrolling through a continuous timeline view of everything that’s happened at your front door is super helpful and means you won’t miss anything. This, along with a good price, great video quality, the ability to tell you what and who is at your door, and some free recorded video, make it the best doorbell for most people.\nThe Nest Wired is also the best video doorbell that works with Google Home, and the best for protecting your packages. Its proactive package watch feature tells you when a package arrives and sends another alert when it’s gone. In my testing, it worked very well.\nUnlike many competitors — such as Ring and Arlo — Google doesn’t charge for smart notifications. The Nest Wired will tell you if it’s a person, package, animal, or vehicle at your door for free. You also get free activity zones to cut down on unwanted notifications, and three free hours of event-based recordings, thanks to local storage and local processing.\n\nYou can, in theory, use this doorbell without paying a subscription\n\n\nBut three hours isn’t enough to be particularly useful, and to get recorded video, you need a Nest Aware plan (starting at $10 per month, $100 per year). This does cover all your Google Nest cameras, though, and it adds Nest’s excellent Familiar Faces feature, which tells you who is at your door.\nIf you want 24/7 recording, you need Nest Aware Plus ($20 per month, $200 a year), but again, this subscription applies to all Google Nest cameras you have.\nOn paper, the Nest doesn’t have the best specs; the Ring Wired Pro is technically better. But it does deliver a 960 x 1280 pixel resolution with a 6x digital zoom, and video quality is very good, thanks to some digital trickery. Its 3:4 portrait aspect ratio and 145-degree field of view are very good, and I could see my porch from top to bottom and a fair amount from side to side.\nOn-device AI makes the Nest speedy with notifications, and it delivers rich alerts to both your phone and watch. These are interactive, allowing you to press and hold the video to see a clip and activate one of the three preset quick responses. It’s also quick to call up live video.\nNest’s doorbells and cameras work with Nest and Amazon Alexa smart displays for viewing a live feed. Google also now lets you have a live stream pull up automatically on your Google TV when someone rings the doorbell — a super handy feature.\nThere are a few quirks. There’s no reliable way to snooze notifications from the doorbell, and if you use multiple Nest speakers or displays, they’ll all announce your visitors. Not great if you have a Nest Mini in your kid’s nursery.\nGoogle is gradually rolling out a search and description feature to its cameras, including video doorbells that will send an alert describing exactly what’s happening in a clip, giving you more context before opening the app. You’ll also be able to search through footage for specific events — like kids on bikes. The search and description feature will require a subscription.\nRead my full Nest Doorbell wired review.\nBest battery-powered doorbell camera\nRing Battery Doorbell Plus\nThis is a great battery-powered buzzer with excellent video quality, a good head-to-toe view, and very speedy response times for a battery doorbell. It integrates well with Amazon Alexa and can record locally to a Ring Alarm Pro, but the battery only lasts about two months unless you turn on battery-saving features.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $149.99 at Target\n $149.99 at Amazon\n $149.99 at The Home Depot\n\nVideo quality: 1536 x 1536p, HDR, color night vision / Smart Alerts: Person, package ($) Aspect ratio: 1:1 / Field of view: 150 degrees horizontal, 150 degrees vertical / Power options: Battery, wired trickle charge, solar / Wi-Fi: 2.4GHz / Storage: Cloud and local (with Ring Alarm Pro) / Subscription fee: $4.99 a month / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings\nIf you really want a battery-powered buzzer, the Ring Battery Doorbell Plus is the way to go. At $149.99, it’s cheaper than the Ring Battery Pro, while still offering a head-to-toe view and high-quality video resolution to provide a clear picture of what’s happening at your door.\nUnlike the $100 Ring Battery Doorbell, the Plus uses removable, rechargeable batteries, making it easier to keep your doorbell charged. Just have a second on hand charged and ready to swap in when you get low. Most other doorbells require you to take them down to recharge.\nThe Plus also has color night vision and was more responsive than any other non-Ring battery doorbell I’ve tested. It pulled up a live view in under four seconds, compared with upwards of 10 seconds for most others.\nAs with other battery-powered doorbells, there’s no preroll. If catching people as they approach your door — not just at your door — is crucial, consider the Battery Doorbell Pro ($229.99). That model adds preroll and improved motion detection using radar, which significantly cuts down on nuisance alerts.\nIt’s only really worth spending the extra $80 if you have lots of trees or passing cars in front of your door and/or you want to make sure you see the whole event when someone approaches your door. The Pro is also compatible with 5GHz Wi-Fi, which could mean faster responses if your front door is close enough to your router. The Plus is 2.4GHz only.\nBattery life isn’t great on either doorbell. They last around two months with all the features turned on except for extra-long recordings (the default is 30 seconds, but it can go up to 120). You can tweak settings to reduce power consumption, but then you have to give up features like HDR (which makes it easier to see faces) and snapshot capture, which takes a picture every five minutes to give you a better idea of what’s been happening at your door.\nAs with all Ring doorbells, there are no animal or vehicle alerts, only people and packages. These require a Ring Home plan starting at $4.99 a month, or $49.99 per year, which also includes 180 days of recorded video.\nAn AI-powered search feature introduced in 2024 lets you search recorded footage for things like animals, vehicles, and even the color of the coat you wore when you left the house. It’s handy for understanding what’s been going on around your home, but you still can’t get an alert when your cat is sitting on your porch.\nOther free features include pre-recorded quick replies, the option to set a motion alert schedule, live view, and two-way audio. The Plus can announce visitors on Echo speakers and automatically initiate a two-way audio/video call on an Echo Show. It won’t work with your existing chime unless you wire it (which also trickle-charges the battery), but Ring sells a plug-in chime.\nThe Plus also works with Ring Edge, a local storage and processing option that requires a Ring Alarm Pro smart hub and a Ring Home Premium subscription ($20 a month, $200 per year). This adds cellular backup through its built-in Eero Wifi system, so it can keep your doorbell online if both the power and internet go out.\nBest budget doorbell camera\nBlink Video Doorbell\nBlink’s buzzer is the best if you’re looking for a budget-friendly option with motion-activated recording and alerts, night vision, two-way audio, and up to two years of battery life. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 at Lowe’s\n $59.99 at The Home Depot\n\nVideo quality: 1080p / Smart alerts: None / Aspect ratio: 16:9 / Field of view: 135 degrees horizontal, 80 degrees vertical / Power options: Wired or battery / Wi-Fi: 2.4GHz / Storage: Cloud or local with a Sync Module / Subscription fee: $3 a month / Works with: Amazon Alexa\nThe Blink Video Doorbell is the best cheap doorbell with a no-subscription option. And while it works as a wired doorbell, it’s also a good option for a battery-powered buzzer, as it can go up to two years on two AAs. I don’t love this doorbell, as video and audio quality are not great, but it’s cheap, it gets the job done, and that battery life is phenomenal.\nThe Blink doesn’t have smart alerts or quick replies, and it only records 1080p video at a standard 16:9 aspect ratio). But the basics are here: motion-activated recording (with a max of 30 seconds), alerts, live view (with caveats), night vision, motion zones, and two-way audio.\nIf you want to pay $50 (often less) to have a camera at your door and be done with it, get the Blink. Cloud storage is also a bargain at $3 a month ($30 a year), or you can do local storage with the Sync Module 2 and a USB stick. You need the Sync Module to initiate a live view through the camera in the app (or you have to pay for the subscription). Without it, you can only see video if there’s a motion event or someone rings the doorbell.\nThe Sync Module is sold with the doorbell as a “doorbell system” for $70, and should pay for itself compared to a monthly subscription.\n\nUniquely for a battery-powered doorbell, the Blink can also be a true hardwired doorbell\n\n\nThe biggest selling point for Blink is the feature that makes its similarly inexpensive security cameras so attractive: up to two years of battery life on two AA lithium batteries. The company has developed a super energy-efficient chip that will power its cameras longer than any other doorbell I’ve tested. (I managed almost a year with very heavy use). \nUniquely for a battery-powered doorbell, the Blink can also be a true hardwired doorbell. When wired, it will activate an existing chime (something neither the sub-$100 Ring nor Wyze doorbells can do) and provide constant power — not just trickle charge. This means it can wake up faster than a battery-powered buzzer and catch your visitor as they arrive. Wiring also adds on-demand two-way audio and live view (otherwise, you can only see the stream if there’s a motion event at the doorbell or someone presses the buzzer.)\nThe Blink comes in white or black and, because it uses just two AA batteries, isn’t as huge as most battery-powered doorbells, making it a more discreet option. However, it is a giant pain in the neck to install; make sure to follow the video instructions Blink provides closely to save a lot of frustration.\nThe biggest drawbacks are lower video quality and poor audio quality (it can be staticky, and it’s push-to-talk — not full duplex), short recording length, and no smart alerts. The app is also a bit tricky to navigate. It doesn’t work with Google Home, but it works great with Alexa, and you can see a live view on Echo Show devices and use any Echo speaker as an indoor chime.\nNote: Blink recently launched a second-generation video doorbell with higher image resolution, a head-to-toe view, and person detection for the same price. I plan to test this soon. You can read more details here.\nBest doorbell camera without a subscription\nTP-Link Tapo D225 Video Doorbell Camera\nAt under $100, this feature-packed, subscription-free doorbell offers a lot of value, including free local recording, 24/7 recording, and smart alerts, plus a robust smart home ecosystem. It’s big, you need a microSD card for recording, and there’s no HDR, but it’s a solid choice.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.99 $88.99 at Amazon\n $99.99 $89.99 at Tapo\n\nVideo quality: 2K HD (no HDR) / Smart alerts: People, packages, pets, vehicles (free) Aspect ratio: 4:3 / Field of view: 180 degrees horizontal / Power options: Battery, wired trickle charge / Wi-Fi: 2.4GHz / Storage: microSD card or cloud / Subscription fee: $2.79 a month / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nYou can use any doorbell on this list without a subscription, but you may sacrifice features like smart alerts, recorded video, and 24/7 continuous recording. If you want these but don’t want to pay a monthly fee, TP-Link’s Tapo D225 is an excellent choice.\nA wired and battery-powered doorbell, the D225 offers free smart alerts for people, packages, pets, and vehicles and can record locally to a microSD card (purchased separately) without paying a subscription. There is an optional cloud service if you want to store your video offsite that also adds rich notifications (where a clip or image shows in the notification), but no other features are locked behind a paywall.\n\nIt is a chunky doorbell and may not meet the spousal approval factor\n\n\nTo get the free recording of motion-activated events, you just need to insert a microSD card (up to 512GB) into the doorbell. While it can run on its built-in 10,000mAh battery, you will need to wire it up for continuous 24/7 recording. This will also trickle charge the battery, and the doorbell will still work and record video, even if your power and Wi-Fi go out.\nThere are a few hoops to jump through to get 24/7 recording working, which can be a bit confusing in the slightly cluttered Tapo app. However, once set up, it will capture everything that happens. This is a great option, considering Nest charges $15 a month for 24/7 recording.\nThe D225 also provides good video quality, a decent zoom, and a nice 4:3 aspect ratio that clearly shows your entire porch from top to bottom and a good view from side to side. There is no HDR imaging, though, so if your porch is covered, it can be hard to make out faces in some lights.\nThe doorbell can work with your existing chime (although, oddly, not if you enable 24/7 recording) but also comes with a plug-in chime. If you don’t wire it, you’ll have to remove it to charge, but the large battery can last up to eight months. The downside is that it is a huge, chunky doorbell, which may not meet the spousal approval factor for a good-looking doorbell.\nAnother neat feature of the Tapo is doorbell calling. When someone rings your doorbell, the alert comes in like a phone call, making it less likely that you’ll miss it. This is something first offered on Arlo buzzers, and Ring says it’s bringing it to its line.\nAs Tapo also offers a wide range of smart home products — including security cameras, smart lights, and robot vacuum cleaners — you can tie your doorbell into smart home routines.\nIf you have lots of devices, the Tapo app can get a bit cluttered. But it’s easy enough to use and packed with features, including quick replies, a privacy mode that turns the camera off, and the ability to schedule notifications, set detection zones, and specify the type of alert you want to get from each one (e.g., only notify me if you see people in this zone and packages in this zone).\nRead my full Tapo D225 review.\nMore expensive, but more flexible\nReolink Battery Doorbell\nThe Reolink is sleeker than the Tapo, with very good video quality and HDR support but no 24/7 recording. It can record local video on a microSD card, Reolink Hub, or FTP server and connect to a platform like Home Assistant. But its battery doesn’t last as long as Tapo’s, the app can be confusing, and the smart alerts are spotty. It works with Amazon Alexa and Google Home.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $119.99 at Amazon\n $119.99 at Reolink\n\nBest wired video doorbell that works with Amazon Alexa and Ring\nRing Wired Doorbell Pro\nThe flagship Ring doorbell has the best video quality, good connectivity, and excellent motion detection. It works smoothly with Amazon Alexa but is expensive, requires a subscription for most features, and doesn’t offer 24/7 recording.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229.99 at Amazon\n $229.99 at Best Buy\n $229.99 at Ring\n\nVideo quality: 1536 x 1536p, HDR / Smart alerts: Person, package ($) Aspect ratio: 1:1 / Field of view: 150 degrees horizontal, 150 degrees vertical / Power options: Wired / Wi-Fi: 2.4GHz and 5GHz / Storage: Cloud and local (with Ring Alarm Pro) / Subscription fee: $4.99 a month / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings\nThe Ring Wired Doorbell Pro (formerly Ring Doorbell Pro 2) — previously my top pick — is the best wired doorbell camera that works with Amazon Alexa and integrates with Ring Alarm and other Ring cameras. It’s more expensive than the Nest Wired — which also works with Alexa — but its video is higher quality and much brighter.\nIt has an ideal square aspect ratio for a full front porch view, speedy notifications, and impressively accurate motion detection using three separate sensors — radar, video analysis, and passive infrared. It also has a nice slim design and multiple faceplate options to fit your decor.\nBut there’s no free video recording, no option for 24/7 recording (yet), and the smart alerts are limited to people and packages. However, you can now search for things like vehicles and animals after the fact with Ring’s Smart Video Search feature. This makes tracking down my cat or checking which delivery driver came by a little easier.\nThe Ring Pro also works with Samsung SmartThings, and while it doesn’t support Apple Home, it can be integrated with extra hardware. There’s no support for Google Home.\nA true wired doorbell, the Ring Pro is one of the most responsive doorbells I’ve tested, delivering notifications immediately. It also has the best range and connectivity, and built-in, full-color preroll helps ensure you don’t miss any crucial action.\nThe Pro has good color night vision, dual-band Wi-Fi, and smart responses (which let your doorbell talk to your visitor for you). The Ring app is best in class, and there are pages of settings you can tinker with. Plus, the timeline view for scrolling through your recordings is very good.\nThe Pro will work with your existing doorbell chime, plus Ring sells a plug-in Chime and Chime Wi-Fi extender that can help boost connectivity while providing a selection of fun doorbell tones.\nAs with most doorbell cameras, the Pro can use Echo smart speakers to announce when someone is at the door. As a Ring doorbell, it can also automatically pull up a live feed of your front door on an Echo Show or Fire TV-enabled television when someone presses the doorbell.\nThe downside is that the Pro is expensive. Its subscription fee starts at $4.99 a month (or $49.99 a year). This adds recorded footage, smart alerts, and an extra six seconds of preroll video, which, in lieu of 24/7 recording, provides plenty of time around motion events to catch all the action.\nThe Pro works with Ring Edge for local storage and video processing, plus the option of cellular backup. But you need a Ring Alarm Pro and Ring Home Premium subscription for this, which costs $20 a month and no longer includes professional monitoring of your alarm (that’s now a $10 add-on).\nRing added 24/7 recording to some wired cameras, a feature that’s included in the $20-a-month Ring Home Premium plan. While this isn’t coming to the wired doorbells at launch, Ring has said the feature will expand to more devices soon.\nRead our Ring Wired Doorbell Pro review.\nA battery-powered alternative\nRing Battery Doorbell Pro\nIf you like the sound of the Wired Pro but don’t have wires, the Ring Battery Doorbell Pro has almost all of the same features —  including head-to-toe view, excellent video, dual-band Wi-Fi, color preroll, color night vision, and noise-canceling audio — in a battery package. It also features radar motion detection, which cuts down on nuisance notifications, and is a great alternative to the Pro 2.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229.99 at Amazon\n $229.99 at Best Buy\n $229.99 at The Home Depot\n\nA great wired doorbell camera for Ecobee users\nEcobee Smart Doorbell Camera\nThis is the only video doorbell that can use an Ecobee thermostat as a video intercom, making it a no-brainer for Ecobee households, as long as you can hook it to your doorbell wiring. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159.99 $119.99 at The Home Depot\n $159.99 $119.99 at Best Buy\n $159.99 $119.99 at Ecobee\n\nVideo quality: 1080p, 8x zoom, color and IR night vision / Smart Alerts: Person, package Aspect ratio: 3:4 portrait / Field of view: 187 degrees diagonal / Power options: Wired / Wi-Fi: 2.4GHz, 5GHz / Storage: Cloud / Subscription fee: $5 a month or $50 a year  / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home\nThe Ecobee Smart Doorbell Camera is a great wired doorbell camera and the only one that can use an Ecobee thermostat as a video intercom — a neat feature. It sends fast, accurate alerts for people and packages, and thanks to radar detection and computer vision motion detection, it never once sent me a false alert.\nThe Ecobee has a comprehensive 187-degree diagonal field of view that lets you see top to bottom and side to side and offers decent 1080p HD video. A subscription is required for viewing recorded video, $5 a month / $50 a year, but alerts for people and packages are free. In 2024, Ecobee introduced the ability to control your Yale or August Wi-Fi-enabled door lock directly from its app, so you can more easily unlock the door for someone from afar.\nOne quirk is that while the Ecobee records all motion (if you subscribe), it only alerts you if it sees people or packages. This does cut down on the number of alerts you get, but I’d like the option to turn motion alerts on, mainly so I can know when my dog has gotten out and is sitting at my front door (especially because there are no animal or vehicle alerts). The doorbell does record all motion events for up to two minutes, so you can go back and view them, but you won’t get notified.\nThe Ecobee works with Apple Home and can ring a HomePod as a chime (as well as your existing chime), plus pull up a live view on your Apple TV. But it doesn’t support HomeKit Secure Video, so you have to pay Ecobee’s subscription fee if you want recorded videos. It also works with Amazon Alexa and recently added support for Google Home. If you have an Ecobee thermostat in a convenient location, this is an excellent option.\nRead my full Ecobee Smart Doorbell Camera review.\nBest video doorbell camera for Apple HomeKit Secure Video\nAqara G4 Video Doorbell\nThe Aqara G4 is an inexpensive HomeKit Secure Video doorbell that also works with Alexa and Google Home. It’s powered by batteries, wires or both, and offers 24/7 local recording. But a 16:9 aspect ratio and poorer video quality let it down. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $119.99 $89.99 at Amazon\n $119.99 $89.99 at Best Buy\n $119.99 $104.6 at The Home Depot\n\nVideo quality: 1080p / Smart Alerts: Person, facial recognition and person, facial recognition, packages with HSV, / Aspect ratio: 16:9 / Field of view: 162 degrees horizontal / Power options: Wired or battery / Wi-Fi: 2.4GHz / Storage: Cloud and local / Subscription fee: Seven days of free cloud storage or 99 cents a month with iCloud / Works with: Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nAqara’s G4 is currently the best video doorbell for Apple Home users, especially if you want 24/7 video recording. It’s also the only battery-powered doorbell that’s compatible with Apple Home, and it works with HomeKit Secure Video.\nIt runs on six standard AA batteries and can be hardwired to support 24/7 video recording (through Aqara’s app, though, not in Apple Home). It’s jam-packed with features, but it’s probably best suited for those who live in apartments as its landscape aspect ratio means it can’t really see packages at the doorstep, and it’s not very weather-resistant.\nAt $120, it’s the least expensive HomeKit option and pairs with the Aqara U100 smart lock (which also works with Apple Home and Home Key) for a nice, fully Apple Home-compatible setup on your front door. As a bonus, you can easily unlock the door from the same screen as viewing your doorbell footage.\nDownsides include a 16:9 aspect ratio (a problem if you want to see packages on your porch), no HDR imaging, which delivers pretty bad video quality, and a finicky chime box that has to be plugged in inside and near the doorbell. That chime also houses a microSD card, which is required for 24/7 recording. Unfortunately, the G4 can’t ring an existing electronic chime, but the chime box is plenty loud, and you can customize the heck out of the sounds.\nThe G4 has smart alerts for people, packages, animals, and vehicles, facial recognition, and the option to announce who is at the door on a connected HomePod or HomePod Mini (you need an Apple Home hub to use this in HomeKit).\nIt responded quickly to doorbell rings and motion alerts, but I had some connectivity issues. Plus, occasionally, I got an overheating warning while testing in May 2024 — and that was before the heatwave we experienced in South Carolina this summer.\nAqara has its own app, which has a ton of innovative features, including custom ringtones for different people, a voice changer, and the option to have your smart home devices react depending on who is at the front door.\nThe Aqara app adds access to 24/7 video, a nice feature to have, especially for free. The implementation is spotty, and video quality is not great, but it will do in a pinch. In addition to Apple Home, the Aqara doorbell works with Google Home and Amazon Alexa.\nNote: Aqara announced the Aqara Doorbell Camera Hub G410 earlier this year, which adds 2K video quality, a 4:3 aspect ratio, and end-to-end encryption of video. You can read more details here. I’ll be testing it soon.\nRead my full Aqara Video Doorbell G4 review.\nBest video doorbell door lock\nEufy FamiLock S3 Max\nEufy FamiLock S3 Max Palm Vein Recognition Wi-Fi Smart Lock\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 $339.99 at Amazon\n $399.99 $339.99 at Eufy\n $399.99 $339.99 at The Home Depot\n\nVideo quality: 2K HD / Smart Alerts: Person, motion, / Aspect ratio: 16:9 / Field of view: 150 degrees horizontal / Power options: Battery / Wi-Fi: 2.4GHz, 5GHz / Storage: Local / Subscription fee: N/A / Works with: Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nEufy’s FamiLock S3 Max is a two-in-one video doorbell and smart lock that manages to handle both functions pretty well. Its $399 price tag may cause sticker shock at first but is easier to accept when you consider the price of a smart door lock and video doorbell together. \nThe FamiLock S3 Max has a 4-inch screen that shows a live video feed of what’s captured by the front camera, so you can check it at a glance without opening your phone. The screen also allows other people in your household to check who’s at the door without having Eufy’s app installed, which is especially helpful for kids and guests. \nYou can unlock the FamiLock S3 Max using an app, PIN code, key, or palm recognition, which works by using infrared light to scan the vascular patterns beneath the palm of your hand. Using palm recognition doesn’t require you to physically touch the door lock and can be more reliable than a fingerprint reader for older folks whose fingerprints have degraded over time. It took a little time to get used to unlocking my door this way, but it worked reliably once I did. To lock the door, you’ll need to push a button on the lock, or enable auto-lock within Eufy’s app.\nRunning both a video doorbell and smart lock takes a lot of power, and in our tests, the FamiLock S3 Max’s battery was down to 41 percent after one month. It does have four AAA batteries to keep basic functions operational while you charge the lock’s main battery. You can also pick up a spare battery from Eufy for $37 if you want to have a fully charged backup at all times. \nIn our tests, the FamiLock S3 Max recorded clear video both day and night, though a protruding door frame blocked part of the camera. You can save video footage for free within Eufy’s app because it’s stored locally rather than in the cloud. You’ll receive an alert when people or motion are detected, but the video doorbell can’t recognized specific events, like package recognition. Hooking it up to Eufy’s HomeBase 3 enables some smart alerts, including pet and vehicle detection and facial recognition, but will set you back $150. \nYou can view a live feed from the camera on an Amazon Alexa or Google Home smart speaker with a screen, but I found it easier to just check the display built into the smart lock. Apple Home support is available on the smart lock portion of the FamiLock S3 Max, but not the video doorbell. Still, if you want both a smart lock and video doorbell without having to install and manage two separate devices, Eufy’s FamiLock S3 Max is a compelling choice.\nRead my full Eufy FamiLock S3 Max review.\nOther doorbell cameras I tested\nThe Reolink Video Doorbell (starting at $119) is a wired version of Reolink’s battery model mentioned above. It’s worth considering if you can use Power over Ethernet (there’s also a Wi-Fi version). There’s also the option of dual-band Wi-Fi, local storage to a microSD card or FTP server, and 24/7 recording with compatible hardware. I tested the black Wi-Fi version ($119.99), which streams good 2K video but only supports person detection (which is fairly inaccurate) and has a more horizontal field of view. The white model has package detection and a more vertical field of view. The battery Reolink adds animal and vehicle alerts and has a better field of view, so it’s the better choice unless you want PoE.\nThe Tapo D210 ($59.99) is a battery-powered doorbell with a similar design to the D225, but there’s no wiring option, so it can’t record 24/7. It does have free local recording with a microSD card and free alerts for people, pets, and vehicles, but there’s no package detection. Its rectangular 16:9 aspect ratio shows less of my porch, and it’s only available in white. While it has a few more features than the similarly priced Blink, it is very big and bulky, has a shorter battery life, and can’t be wired to trickle-charge or ring your existing chime (it does come with a plug-in chime). \nThe Ring Battery Doorbell ($99.99) suffers badly from the back-of-the-head problem common with battery-powered buzzers. Other than that, it’s a fine basic buzzer, but it doesn’t have removable batteries. While the redesigned quick-release system makes it easier to remove the doorbell to charge, the Plus is worth the extra money for the added convenience and better video resolution. The one thing this Ring has going for it is its slim profile, which makes it a good option if you want something more discreet.\nThe Google Nest Doorbell (battery) is worth considering if you are in a Google household and can’t wire your doorbell, but it is big and bulky. Plus, you have to remove it to charge. Specs and price-wise, it’s the same as my top pick, the Nest Doorbell (wired), but it can’t record 24/7, which the wired Nest can. It’s also twice the size of the wired model. \nThe Eufy Video Doorbell Dual is a previous pick that doesn’t require any monthly fees and records footage locally. But at $250, it’s very expensive, and there are now better, cheaper options. It’s still great thanks to its dual camera feature that lets you see your porch and your visitor with a wide view, plus free smart alerts, including facial recognition and a neat uncollected package alert. It’s worth considering if you already have a Eufy HomeBase. You can read my full review here.\nThe Wyze Video Doorbell Pro is a battery buzzer with impressive features for its price, and if you hardwire it, you get preroll video. However, a five-minute cooldown period between recordings, unless you pay for a subscription, is an inexcusable amount of time that negates its offer of “free recording.” Plus, Wyze has had some major security issues in the past.\nThe Ring Video Doorbell Wired is a budget buzzer at just $60, but it won’t work with your existing chime and doesn’t draw the same amount of power from those wires as the Ring Pro 2, making it generally less reliable. Without HDR, its video quality is spotty.\nThe Logitech Circle View Wired is another Apple HomeKit Secure video option I tested, which, while fast, is expensive, only works with Apple Home, and frequently dropped off my Wi-Fi network. \nIn addition to Eufy’s FamiLock S3 Max, I’ve also tested the Lockly Vision Elite and the Eufy Security S330 Video Smart Lock. Both are very expensive and work better as door locks than doorbells. But if you have a specific need for this device (e.g., you have nowhere else to put a doorbell camera), then they are useful for at least seeing up the nose of whoever is at your door, if not much beyond that.\nDoorbell cameras I plan to test\nBlink launched an upgraded version of its doorbell in May. The Blink Video Doorbell (newest model) is the same price as the current model ($69.99) but adds a head-to-toe view of your porch, 1440p x 1440p image resolution, and person detection. It requires a Sync Module to work, which the current version doesn’t.\nThe Aqara Doorbell Camera Hub G410 is an upgrade to the G4. It offers 2K video quality, a 4:3 aspect ratio, and end-to-end encryption, along with a mmWave sensor for more accurate person detection. Uniquely, it uses dual-band Wi-Fi and is a Zigbee, Thread, and Matter smart home hub for Aqara’s wide smart home system.\nThe Arlo Video Doorbell (wired / wireless) is the second generation of the excellent Arlo Essential wired, which was a former pick in this guide. It doesn’t have the option of wiring only; instead, it’s a battery doorbell you can wire to trickle-charge. There’s a choice between 1080p ($79.99) and 2K ($129.99) resolutions, and it features a 180-degree field of view and an integrated siren. Recording and smart alerts require a $10 per month subscription ($8 if paying annually), and there’s no local storage or 24/7 recording, but there are AI-powered features (including facial recognition).\nSwitchbot’s first video doorbell comes with an in-home display/chime to give you a quick way of seeing who  is at the door. No price, release date, or further details are known yet.\nThe $50 Kasa Smart Doorbell (KD110) from TP-Link comes with a plug-in chime, 2K video quality, free person detection, and the option of local storage to a microSD card. It’s a wired doorbell with a 160-degree viewing angle and works with Amazon Alexa and Google Home.\nI plan to test several subscription-free doorbells from Eufy, including the Eufy Doorbell E3340, C210, and S220.\nWhat’s coming next?\nSignify announced the Hue Secure video doorbell at IFA 2025. It launches in October for $169. It features a 2K image sensor, has a built-in Zigbee radio to communicate with Hue lights and other home automation devices, and can record videos in a square aspect ratio. Its built-in chime can be integrated into a Hue security system and used as a siren when it’s triggered. Signify’s CEO George Yianni confirmed to The Verge that the video doorbell lets you view video clips captured by the video doorbell over the previous 24 hours without paying a subscription fee. The Hue Secure video doorbell won’t support Matter at launch, but is slated to arrive this fall when Matter 1.5 is released. Similarly, Apple Home support will be added after it ships. \nAndroid Authority spotted the third-generation Nest Video Doorbell within the Google Home app’s new device setup screen. It’s no longer visible from this menu — Google likely fixed the secret-spoiling error — but it suggests an announcement for the updated video doorbell could happen soon. Relatedly, a photo posted on the Nest subreddit shows an unannounced third-generation Nest Video Doorbell behind a locked case at a Home Depot store, along with other Nest hardware.\nPhotos by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, September 8th: Adjusted pricing and availability throughout and included information about the upcoming Hue Secure video doorbell and leaks surrounding the third-generation Nest Video Doorbell.

      "raw": "The 2025-2026 college football season kicked off last week. If you want something to do while you wait for your favorite team to hit the field every week through the fall, I encourage you to check out EA Sports’ College Football 26, which is $49.99 ($20 off) at Best Buy, Walmart, and Amazon on PS5 (disc) and Xbox Series X (disc or digital). This game builds on the stellar College Football 25, EA’s first college football game in over a decade.\nIn case you missed its big relaunch last year, EA’s back to making annual college football games now that it has a way to pay players who opt in to have their name, image, and likeness included. Athletes were paid $1,500 each to be in this year’s title, and were given a free copy.\nEA Sports College Football 26\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 $49.99 at Amazon\n $69.99 $49.99 at Walmart\n $69.99 $49.99 at Best Buy\n\nSome more Verge-approved deals\nAnker’s compact Nano Travel Adapter in white or black is down to $19.99 at Amazon. It’s just small $5 discount, but this is something that’s worth jumping on if you’re planning international travel any time soon. Its slim design aside, I like that it has four ports (two USB-C, two USB-A), and support for Type A, I, G, and C plugs, which allows it to work in over 200 countries and regions, according to Anker. In terms of USB power, it’s on the slow side — best for when you want to charge gadgets overnight. For instance, one of the USB-C ports can deliver 20W to a device, or you’ll get 15W total when you’ve got two USB-C devices plugged in. Using all four ports will split 15W across devices.\nAnother inexpensive accessory that’d be great for travel, or even just for your daily commute, is Anker’s Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds that have active noise cancellation. They’re typically priced at around $79.99 at Amazon, but they recently dropped down to $44.99 in the white, blue, or black. This model can last 10 hours on a charge, and its wireless charging-supported case can fully recharge them five times, totaling 50 hours of playback. These also support multipoint, letting you connect to two devices at once via Bluetooth.\nLastly, there’s a solid deal happening Logitech’s G203 wired gaming mouse at Amazon, where the black version with RGB LED detailing costs $18.99. This half-price discount is great for PC gamers on a budget, as well as for others who want a comfortable mouse with some customizable buttons and lighting. In addition to its two main buttons, the G203 has two thumb buttons, a tactile scroll wheel, and a DPI switcher on its top to change pointer sensitivity. It’s nothing fancy, but you may find this sub-$20 mouse meets all (or at least most) of your criteria.",
