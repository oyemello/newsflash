      "raw": "Apple just announced the thinnest iPhone ever, the iPhone Air, which measures just 5.6mm thick.\nThe new iPhone Air comes with a 6.5-inch ProMotion display with an up to 120Hz refresh rate. It also has 3,000 nits of peak brightness. Apple says the design is its “most durable” yet, featuring a ceramic shield that encloses a titanium frame on both sides.\nIt features a new A19 Pro processor, the most powerful iPhone chip yet, also announced today. And, despite how thin it is, Apple promises “remarkable” battery life.\nThe iPhone Air is supposed to mark the beginning of the company’s three-year plan to revamp its iPhone lineup with new designs and form factors — not just simple spec bumps, according to a recent report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.\n The launch of the iPhone Air coincides with the upcoming release of iOS 26. The updated operating system features a new Liquid Glass design language that gives some of its navigational elements and icons a bubbly, transparent look that had some users divided during the beta testing period.\nDeveloping… see our live blog for the latest details.",

This iteration has been upgraded with a larger 6.3-inch display and a 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate. It comes in some lightly refreshed color variations, but otherwise preserves much of the iPhone 16 design.\nSome of the biggest updates for this generation are the cameras, including a 48-megapixel “dual fusion” camera system on the rear that combines the capabilities of a main camera and telephoto camera into one, according to Apple.\nThe iPhone 17‘s predecessor saw some big changes last year. The iPhone 16 adopted the Action Button, which had previously been exclusive to the Pro line; it reintroduced the vertical dual-camera arrangement, which had last been seen on the iPhone 12; and it added the Camera Control button, which also debuted on the iPhone 16 Pro.\nApple also heavily pushed the iPhone 16’s AI capabilities. But in the end, many of its flagship Apple Intelligence features didn’t ship. That didn’t seem to hurt the launch, though, with the iPhone 16 managing to outperform the iPhone 15 in Apple’s year-over-year Q4 sales.\nDeveloping… see our live blog for the latest details.",

It will start at $799 and come in natural and black titanium.\nThe new Ultra follows the Apple Watch Ultra 2, which Apple announced in 2023; the black version of the Ultra 2, which Apple introduced last year; and the original Apple Watch Ultra, which Apple launched in 2022. Apple’s Ultra watches are generally targeted toward athletes and sporty types, with features like big battery life (Apple promises up to 36 hours in “normal use” with the Apple Watch Ultra 2), bright displays, and improved GPS for tracking workouts. They also have had a high starting price of $799.\nIn addition to the new watch, Apple is launching watchOS 26 this fall, which includes features like an Apple Intelligence-powered “Workout Buddy,” an improved Smart Stack, a wrist flick gesture to dismiss notifications, and Apple’s new Liquid Glass design language (which is also coming to other Apple products).\nDeveloping… see our live blog for the latest details.",

Like the Series 11 and Ultra 3, the SE 3’s front crystal uses Apple’s Ion-X glass, which the company claims is twice as scratch-resistant as its previous glass.\nThe 2025 Apple Watch SE is a follow-up to the outgoing model, which was launched back in 2022. It’s once again Apple’s new base model wearable —  typically a parts-bin remix of previous and current flagship features for a lower price.

      "raw": "Apple just announced the AirPods Pro 3, the first major update to the product in three years. Apple is introducing a new heart rate sensor in the AirPods Pro 3, as well as improved active noise cancellation (ANC), and a live translation feature. You’ll be able to preorder the AirPods Pro 3 today for $249, and they’ll start shipping on September 19th.\nApple is upgrading the audio quality in AirPods Pro 3, with a widened sound stage and improved noise cancellation. Apple says the AirPods Pro 3 will deliver the “world’s best ANC,” thanks to foam-infused ear tips for greater noise isolation. Apple claims this will enable twice the ANC than the previous generation of AirPods Pro, and “deliver the world’s best ANC of any in-ear wireless headphones.”\nPerhaps the biggest upgrade on the AirPods Pro 3 will be the new heart rate sensor. Apple is using its smallest heart rate sensor on the AirPods Pro 3, which is a custom photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor that “shines invisible infrared light pulsed at 256 times per second to measure light absorption in blood flow.”\nThe sensor works with the AirPods Pro accelerometers, gyroscope, GPS, and a new on-device AI model on an iPhone to track heart rate, calories burned, and activity. There’s also a new workout experience, Workout Buddy, in the iPhone fitness app that uses Apple Intelligence to track workout data and fitness history.\nApple is also bringing a new live translation feature to the AirPods Pro 3. ANC will lower the volume of the speaker and play audio back to you in your own language. “When enabled, Live Translation helps users understand another language and communicate with others by speaking naturally with AirPods,” explains Apple. “To interact with someone who doesn’t have this hands-free capability, there’s an option to use iPhone as a horizontal display, showing the live transcription of what the user is saying in the other person’s preferred language.”\nApple is also improving how AirPods Pro 3 fit in people’s ears. Apple says it has analyzed more than 10,000 3D ear scans and made each AirPod Pro smaller. The design is shaped to better fit inside the ear canal, and there are now five sizes of ear tips. Apple has even made the AirPods Pro 3 more durable, with IP57 sweat and water resistance.\nIn addition to the AirPods Pro 3, Apple is also bringing several new features to its AirPods with the release of iOS 26 this fall. AirPods will be able to be used as a camera remote for the camera app in iOS 26, and AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 will now support studio-quality audio for songs, videos, podcasts, and more. Apple is also improving the call quality in iOS 26 for AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, as well improving charging reminders and pausing audio if you fall asleep.\nApple last made a major update to its AirPods Pro line with the second-generation debut three years ago, with improvements to sound quality, noise cancellation, and a built-in speaker in the charging case. Apple then updated the AirPods Pro 2 in 2023 with dust resistance and a USB-C charging case instead of the company’s Lightning port.",

After arriving back in the country, Thaksin spent less than 24 hours in jail, but was moved to the VIP wing of a hospital on health grounds, where he stayed for six months before he was released on parole.\n\r\n In its judgment, the supreme court found that the arrangement allowing Thaksin to stay at hospital was unlawful. “The defendant knows his sickness was not an urgent matter, and staying in hospital cannot count as a prison term,” said the ruling read out by a judge.\n\r\n “The court will issue a jail warrant and an official from Bangkok Remand Prison will take him,” the judge said.\n Continue reading...",
