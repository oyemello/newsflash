      "raw": "Microsoft has avoided a fine from the European Commission after it was charged with EU antitrust violations for bundling its Teams app with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 subscriptions. The European Commission says it has accepted commitments from Microsoft to address competition concerns related to Microsoft Teams, following an anti-competitive complaint filed by Slack in July 2020.\n“The commitments address the Commission’s concerns related to the tying of Microsoft Teams to the company’s popular productivity applications Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, included in its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites for business customers,” says the European Commission.\nMicrosoft has committed to do the following:\nMake available versions of its Office suites without Teams and at a reduced price\nAllow customers with long-term licenses to switch to suites without Teams\nProvide interoperability for key functionalities between communication and collaboration tools that compete with Teams and certain Microsoft products\nAllow customers to move their data out of Teams to facilitate the use of competing solutions\nMost of the commitments from Microsoft will be enforced by EU lawmakers for seven years, with the interoperability and data portability ones in force for 10 years. Microsoft originally unbundled Teams from Office in Europe in 2023 in an attempt to address regulator concerns, and then spun off Teams from Office 365 as its own separate app globally last year.\n“Organizations big and small across Europe and around the world rely heavily on videoconferencing, chat and collaboration tools, especially since the coronavirus pandemic,” says Teresa Ribera, executive vice president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission. “Today’s decision therefore opens up competition in this crucial market, and ensures that businesses can freely choose the communication and collaboration product that best suits their needs.”\nEU lawmakers first opened a Microsoft antitrust investigation into Teams bundling in 2023, after Slack filed its anti-competitive complaint amid intense competition with Microsoft that developed after the covid-19 pandemic began. Slack’s original complaint alleged that Microsoft had “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.”",

      "raw": "Asus’ ProArt P16 laptop is getting RTX 50-series GPUs and a unique new screen in its high-end configuration. Its biggest upgrades include Nvidia’s top-tier RTX 5090 mobile GPU and a bright 16-inch 3840 x 2400 tandem OLED touchscreen, capable of up to 1,600 nits of brightness in HDR and 120Hz refresh with VRR. The new flagship P16 will cost $3,999.99 at Best Buy and direct from Asus when it launches internationally in mid-October and in the US in December.\nOther key specs and features of the P16 include an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU (same as the 2024 model), 64GB of LPDDR5X RAM, 4TB of SSD storage (via two 2TB NVMe drives), Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 5.4. It’s also got a bunch of ports, including one 40Gbps USB4, one 10Gbps USB-C 3.2 Gen 2, two 10Gbps USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, HDMI 2.1, a 3.5mm audio jack, and SD Express 7.0 card slot.\nIt’s a whole lot of laptop, designed to be a direct Windows alternative to a 16-inch MacBook Pro (it even comes in all black). Like previous P16s, it’s basically a creator-focused version of the Intel-based Asus ROG Zephyrus G16. That means it’s fairly thin at 14.9mm / 0.59 inches, and at 1.95kg / 4.3 pounds it’s decently light for its size. It also means it’s likely to have at least a little thermal throttling under the heaviest of loads from creative apps and graphically intensive games — as has been the case for the Zephyrus laptops. And Asus’ tech specs track with that, as the P16’s 5090 GPU is rated for up to 120W total graphics power (TGP), though the card can potentially go up to 150W according to Nvidia.\nStill, just like the ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16 are excellent gaming laptops (particularly if you value portability), the new P16 sounds pretty good for a creative laptop — at least on paper. To cater it more toward creators than the Zephyrus line, Asus put that brighter tandem OLED screen with more resolution and touch compatibility in the new flagship config. The P16 also features Asus’ DialPad, a ring-shaped dial built into the trackpad for extra control of sliders in creative apps like those from Adobe.\nIf $4,000 is too high an asking price, Asus is also keeping the entry-level 2024 model with an RTX 4060 around for $1,999.99. And there are mid-tier options for the new 2025 version with RTX 5070 and 5080 GPU options, the former of which starts at $2,499.99 and sports the same AMD Ryzen 370HX CPU, 32GB of RAM, 2TB SSD, and a non-tandem 4K / 60Hz OLED display. Not as fancy-sounding as Asus’ halo config, but not too shabby either.",

We are actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement. Together, we remain focused on delivering the best AI tools for everyone, grounded in our shared commitment to safety.\nMicrosoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI since 2019, and shares in the revenue earned by ChatGPT as well as its API. Microsoft also now includes OpenAI as a competitor, allows OpenAI to lean on other cloud providers for compute power, and has started to increase its reliance on its own AI models. \nIn a company town hall meeting on Thursday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and AI chief Mustafa Suleyman committed to “significant investments” in its own models. “We should have the capacity to build world class frontier models in house of all sizes, but we should be very pragmatic and use other models where we need to,” said Suleyman.\nThere was one specific detail about the agreement with Microsoft released by OpenAI in another statement, saying that its nonprofit parent company will continue to hold authority over the for-profit business, with an equity stake worth more than $100 billion. \nOther philanthropies and nonprofits have reportedly pushed back against OpenAI’s unusual restructuring plan, and the attorneys general of California and Delaware have opened investigations. In its announcement, OpenAI said, “We continue to work with the California and Delaware Attorneys General as an important part of strengthening our approach, and we remain committed to learning and acting with urgency to ensure our tools are helpful and safe for everyone, while advancing safety as an industry-wide priority.”",

Claude’s memory also carries over to projects, a feature that lets Pro and Teams generate things like diagrams, website designs, graphics, and more, based on files they upload to the chatbot. \nIt seems to be particularly focused on work-related details, like a “team’s processes” and “client needs.” Anthropic notes that memory is “fully optional.”\nAnthropic says users can view and edit the memory Claude has stored from their settings menu. “Based on what you tell Claude to focus on or to ignore, Claude will adjust the memories it references,” Anthropic says. Both OpenAI and Google have already launched cross-chat memories for their chatbots. Last month, a report from The New York Times linked ChatGPT’s rollout of cross-chat memories to an increase in reports of “delusional” AI chats.\nAlong with memories, Anthropic is rolling out incognito chats for all users, which Claude won’t save to its chat history or refer to in future chats.

Numerous users replied with AI-upscaled, “enhanced” versions of the pictures almost immediately, turning the pixelated surveillance shots into sharp, high-resolution images. But AI tools aren’t uncovering secret details in a fuzzy picture, they’re inferring what might be there — and they have a track record of showing things that don’t exist.\nMany AI-generated photo variations were posted under the original images, some apparently created with X’s own Grok bot, others with tools like ChatGPT. They vary in plausibility, though some are obviously off, like an “AI-based textual rendering” showing a clearly different shirt and Gigachad-level chin. The images are ostensibly supposed to help people find the person of interest, although they’re also eye-grabbing ways to get likes and reposts.\nBut it’s unlikely any of them are more helpful than the FBI’s photos. In past incidents, AI upscaling has done things like “depixelating” a low-resolution picture of President Barack Obama into a white man and adding a nonexistent lump to President Donald Trump’s head. It extrapolates from an existing image to fill in gaps, and while that can be useful under certain circumstances, you definitely shouldn’t treat it as hard evidence in a manhunt.\nHere is the original post from the FBI, for reference:\n\n\nWe are asking for the public's help identifying this person of interest in connection with the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. \n1-800-CALL-FBI\nDigital media tips: https://t.co/K7maX81TjJ pic.twitter.com/ALuVkTXuDc\n— FBI Salt Lake City (@FBISaltLakeCity) September 11, 2025\n\n\nAnd below are some examples of attempted “enhancements.”",

      "raw": "The work of creating artificial intelligence that holds to the guardrails of human values, known in the industry as alignment, has developed into its own (somewhat ambiguous) field of study rife with policy papers and benchmarks to rank models against each other. \nBut who aligns the alignment researchers? \nEnter the Center for the Alignment of AI Alignment Centers, an organization purporting to coordinate thousands of AI alignment researchers into “one final AI center singularity.”\nAt first glance, CAAAC seems legitimate. The aesthetics of the website are cool and calming, with a logo of converging arrows reminiscent of the idea of togetherness and sets of parallel lines swirling behind black font. \nBut stay on the page for 30 seconds and the swirls spell out “bullshit,” giving away that CAAAC is all one big joke. One second longer and you’ll notice the hidden gems tucked away in every sentence and page of the fantasy center’s website. \nCAAAC launched Tuesday from the same team that brought us The Box, a literal, physical box that women can wear on dates to avoid the threat of their image being turned into AI-generated deepfake slop. \n“This website is the most important thing that anyone will read about AI in this millenium or the next,” said CAAAC cofounder Louis Barclay, staying in character when talking to The Verge. (The second founder of CAAAC wished to remain anonymous, according to Barclay.) \nCAAAC’s vibe is so similar to AI alignment research labs — who are featured on the website’s homepage with working links to their own websites — that even those in the know initially thought it was real, including Kendra Albert, a machine learning researcher and technology attorney, who spoke with The Verge. \nCAAAC makes fun of the trend, according to Albert, of those who want to make AI safe drifting away from the “real problems happening in the real world” — such as bias in models, exacerbating the energy crisis, or replacing workers — to the “very, very theoretical” risks of AI taking over the world, Albert said in an interview with The Verge. \nTo fix the “AI alignment alignment crisis,” CAAAC will be recruiting its global workforce exclusively from the Bay Area. All are welcome to apply, “as long as you believe AGI will annihilate all humans in the next six months,” according to the jobs page. \nThose who are willing to take the dive to work with CAAAC — the website urges all readers to bring their own wet gear — need only comment on the LinkedIn post announcing the center to automatically become a fellow. CAAAC also offers a generative AI tool to create your own AI center, complete with an executive director, in “less than a minute, zero AI knowledge required.” \nThe more ambitious job seeker applying to the “AI Alignment Alignment Alignment Researcher” position will, after clicking through the website, eventually find themselves serenaded by Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up.”",
