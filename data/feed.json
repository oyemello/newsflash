      "raw": "New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing the banks behind Zelle over claims that their payment platform enabled “massive amounts of fraud” that caused customers to lose more than $1 billion between 2017 and 2023. In the lawsuit, James alleges Zelle was rushed to market, resulting in a design that made the platform “an obvious conduit for fraudulent activity.”\nEarly Warning Services (EWS), a company owned by major institutions including Bank of America, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and others, launched Zelle in 2017 as a way to let customers send money from their bank account to other users on the platform. However, James claims EWS “knew from the beginning that key features of the Zelle network made it uniquely susceptible to fraud” and still “failed to adopt basic safeguards.”\nOne of the alleged issues highlighted by James’ lawsuit includes a registration process that ”lacked important verification steps” that enabled scammers to sign up using misleading email addresses, which they could use to pose as a government employee or business to trick Zelle customers into sending them money that they couldn’t get back. Following government pressure, Zelle began paying back victims of imposter scams in 2023.\nAdditionally, James claims EWS did not ensure that banks reported customer complaints about fraud in a “timely” manner and falsely advertised the service as a “safe” money transfer tool. “Even when EWS did receive reports of fraud, it failed to promptly remove the fraudsters from the Zelle network or require banks to reimburse consumers for certain scams,” James alleges.\nThe lawsuit touches on many of the same points as the one initially filed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In March, the CFPB dropped its lawsuit against Zelle amid the Trump administration’s attempt to dismantle the agency and the firing of former head Rohit Chopra, who had taken an aggressive approach to tech regulation. That still hasn’t stopped scrutiny from federal lawmakers — and now, New York’s attorney general.\nZelle spokesperson Eric Blankenbaker pushed back on these claims in a statement to The Verge, saying Zelle “leads the fight to stop fraud and scams” in the US. “This lawsuit is a political stunt to generate press, not progress,” Blankenbaker says. “The Attorney General wants to hand criminals a blueprint for guaranteed payouts with no consequences, opening the floodgates to more scams, not less. That’s bad policy and puts consumers at greater risk.”\nAttorney General James claims EWS violated New York law and is asking for restitution and damages for all New Yorkers harmed by scams on Zelle. “I look forward to getting justice for the New Yorkers who suffered because of Zelle’s security failures,” James said in the press release.",

The most notable update, thanks to product shots shared by reliable leaker Roland Quandt, is a new square design for the camera, which has previously been pill-shaped. It will also supposedly be called the Insta360 Go Ultra, instead of the Insta360 Go 4 had the company stuck with its previous naming convention.\nAccording to the leaks, the Insta 360 Go Ultra measures a little over an inch on each side (30mm) with the lens located in the corner of the camera. It weighs 53 grams, which is quite a bit heavier than the 35.5 gram Go 3 and 26.5 gram Go 2, but the Go Ultra features a new 1/1.28-inch sensor and 4K/60fps video capabilities. That’s twice the framerate of the updated Go 3S that was introduced about a year ago.\nThe camera will feature stabilization and a horizon lock feature, as well as an Active HDR mode that can capture more vivid videos when recording at 4K/30fps. The Go Ultra will also include a redesigned Action Pod dock that includes a flip-up screen for live previews and doubles as a wireless remote. It will also boost the Go Ultra’s runtime, but specific details about the new camera’s battery life aren’t known yet.\nAs for a potential release date? Previous iterations of the Insta 360 Go have debuted in June and even earlier, but leaks haven’t yet revealed when the company plans to officially launch the latest version.",

      "raw": "Any ebook reader will let you cram a Beauty and the Beast-sized library’s worth of books in your pocket, but so will your phone. An ebook reader offers a more book-like reading experience, with fewer distractions and less eye strain, and many include extra features, like adjustable frontlighting. Some really are pocketable. Others are waterproof or offer physical page-turning buttons, while a few even let you take notes.\nI’ve been using ebook readers for nearly a decade, and I’ve gone hands-on with dozens, from the Kindle Paperwhite to lesser-known rivals like the Pocketbook Era. Whether you want something your kid can throw against the wall or a waterproof, warm-glow Kindle that won’t ruin your spa ambiance, these are the best ebook readers for everyone. \nFeatured in this article\nBest Kindle: Kindle Paperwhite (2024)\nAmazon’s latest Paperwhite features a seven-inch display, quick performance, and IPX8 waterproofing. It’s cheaper than its rivals, though, while offering many of the same features.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159.99 at Amazon\n $159.99 at Best Buy\n $159.99 at Target\n\nBest cheap ebook reader: 2024 Kindle\nThe most pocketable Kindle offers many of the Paperwhite’s best features, only for less. It includes a 300ppi display and USB-C charging, but it lacks waterproofing and adjustable color temperature.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $109.99 at Amazon\n $109.99 at Best Buy\n $109.99 at Target\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Kindle\nThe best non-Amazon ebook reader\nThe best cheap ebook reader\nThe best ebook reader for taking notes\nOther ebook readers that didn’t make the cut\nWhat’s coming next\n\nThe best Kindle\nKindle Paperwhite (2024)\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nThe best-looking screen on any e-reader\nSlightly larger screen without a noticeably larger device\nFaster page turns, loading, and a more responsive UI\nA splash of color (without a color screen)\n\nUpgrades aren’t as significant as the last Paperwhite\nLacks stylus support and page turn buttons\nSignature Edition wireless charging is frustrating without magnets\nSignature Edition back panel feels less grippy\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159.99 at Best Buy (ad-supported)\n $159.99 at Target (ad-supported)\n\nDimensions: 7 x 5 x .3 inches / Weight: 211 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: IPX8 waterproofing, Bluetooth audio support \nIf you mostly buy ebooks from Amazon, you’ll want a Kindle, and the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite is the best choice for most people. Starting at $159.99, it’s cheaper than the Kobo Libra Colour — my top non-Amazon ebook reader, which I’ll dive into later — while offering many of the same features. Those include a spacious 7-inch 300pi display with rich contrast levels and an adjustable warm white frontlight, which make for a clear and enjoyable reading experience. The latter also conveniently improves sleep by cutting down on blue light that interrupts melatonin production. \nThat warm white frontlighting is an advantage over the cool white of the $109.99 base-model Kindle, and unlike the base Kindle, the Paperwhite has IPX8 water resistance. The $ 199.99 Signature Edition Paperwhite also has an auto-adjusting frontlight and no lockscreen ads. It has wireless charging, which is a rare feature to find in an e-reader.\nAmazon is the largest online retailer in the world, and it dominates the US ebook market, so Kindle owners have access to advantages owners of other ebook readers don’t. Much of Amazon’s hardware strategy depends on offering cut-rate discounts to pull you into its content ecosystem. If you have Prime and buy a lot of Kindle ebooks, the Paperwhite is the best choice because Amazon makes it incredibly easy to buy and read its stuff. Its ebooks and audiobooks are often on sale, and Prime members get more free content through Prime Reading. Rivals like Kobo offer sales, too, but it’s hard for them to offer discounts as steep as Amazon.\nThere are downsides, though. The Paperwhite has lockscreen ads unless you pay $20 extra to get rid of them. It’s also too big to hold comfortably with one hand. Perhaps the Kindle Paperwhite’s biggest flaw, though — which it shares with all Kindles aside from Fire tablets — is that it’s not easy to read books purchased outside of Amazon’s store. Kindle ebook formats are proprietary and only work on Kindle. Unlike Kobo and other ebook readers, Kindles don’t support EPUB files, an open file format used by pretty much everyone except Amazon. So, for example, if you often shop from Kobo’s bookstore (or Barnes & Noble or Google Play Books or many other ebook stores), you can’t easily read those books on a Kindle without using a workaround. There are ways to convert and transfer file formats so you can read on the Kindle and vice versa, but it’ll take a couple of extra steps.\nHowever, if you don’t buy your books elsewhere or you don’t mind shopping from Amazon, you’ll be more than happy with the Kindle Paperwhite.\nRead our Kindle Paperwhite review.\nThe best non-Amazon ebook reader\nKobo Libra Colour (32GB, ad-free)\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nNice color screen with sharp, 300ppi black-and-white resolution\nPhysical page-turning buttons\nBuilt-in stylus support\nCompatible with Overdrive \n\nGetting books from other stores onto the device can be tough\nMore expensive than the Kindle Paperwhite\nLacks the vibrancy of other color e-readers\nNo wireless charging\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229.99 at Amazon\n $229.99 at Rakuten Kobo\n $229.99 at Target\n\nDimensions: 5.69 x 6.34 x 0.33 inches / Weight: 199.5 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi  (black-and-white), 150ppi (color) / Storage: 32GB / Other features: Physical page-turning buttons, waterproofing, Kobo Stylus 2 support, Bluetooth audio support \nThe Kobo Libra Colour is an excellent alternative to Amazon’s ebook readers, especially for readers outside the US or anyone who doesn’t want to tap into Amazon’s ecosystem. Kobo’s latest slate offers many of the standout features found on the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite — including waterproofing, USB-C support, and a 300ppi display — along with a few perks that make it more helpful and enjoyable to use.\nThe color display is the most obvious. The Libra Colour uses E Ink’s latest Kaledio color screen technology, which provides soothing, pastel-like hues that still pop in direct sunlight. It’s not as sharp as reading in monochrome — the resolution drops to 150ppi when viewing content in color — but it’s a nice touch that makes viewing a wider range of content more pleasant. Book covers and comics, while still muted, have an added layer of depth, even if the colors are nowhere near as vivid as that of a traditional LED tablet or as vibrant as the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition.\nHowever, unlike the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, the Libra Colour works with a digital pen — the Kobo Stylus 2 (sold separately) — which lets you highlight text in various colors or take notes using Kobo’s integrated notebooks. You can also take advantage of some of the more advanced capabilities found in the Kobo Elipsa 2E, allowing you to solve math equations, convert handwriting into typed text, and insert diagrams. This lets the Libra Colour function as a mini notebook of sorts, though I wouldn’t use it as a primary note-taking device since the seven-inch display can feel cramped to write on.\nThe color display is only part of the appeal, though. The Libra Colour doesn’t have the lockscreen ads on the base Paperwhite — and packs physical page-turning buttons, which feel more intuitive to use than tapping either side of the display as you have to do on Amazon’s modern e-readers. The speedy e-reader also supports more file formats, including EPUB files, and makes it much easier to borrow books from the Overdrive library system. Until recently, Kobo offered support for the bookmarking app Pocket, which was another big selling point as it let you read saved articles offline. As of July 8th, the app is no longer available, though Kobo’s CEO suggested in May that the company is seeking a replacement.\nHowever, at $229.99, the Libra Colour costs $70 more than the entry-level Paperwhite — and that’s without Kobo’s $69.99 stylus, which is required for performing certain tasks. That gap widens further when the Paperwhite is on sale, which happens more often than the Libra Colour. The Kobo can’t easily tap into Amazon’s vast library of ebooks, which can be frustrating if you’ve amassed a collection of Kindle titles over the years. It can be done, but you have to convert file formats using third-party apps, which is tricky and can take time.\nBut if those things don’t matter or apply to you, the Kobo Libra Colour will give you the best digital reading experience of all the e-readers on our list. It’s my personal favorite.\nRead our Kobo Libra Colour review.\nThe best cheap ebook reader\nKindle (2024)\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent, high-resolution display\nEasy to hold with one hand\nFaster than its predecessor with improved battery life\nFun color options\n\nNo waterproofing\nLacks adjustable color temperature\nSlightly more expensive than its predecessor\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $109.99 at Amazon (with ads)\n $109.99 at Best Buy (with ads)\n $129.99 at Amazon (without ads)\n\nDimensions: 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches / Weight: 158 grams / Screen area and resolution: 6-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: USB-C support, Bluetooth audio support \nThe base-model Kindle ($109.99 with ads) is the best cheap ebook reader. Its 300ppi resolution makes text clearer and easier to read than the lower-resolution screens on other ebook readers in its price range. Plus, it has USB-C for relatively fast charging. \nReading on its six-inch screen feels a little more cramped than it does on the larger displays of the Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Colour. However, the flip side is that its small size makes it pocketable, light, and easy for small hands to hold. Combined with its relatively affordable price, the Kindle is also the best ebook reader for kids — especially the Amazon Kindle Kids Edition which costs $20 more. The kid-friendly version shares the same specs but is ad-free with parental controls, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a case. It also comes with six months of Amazon Kids Plus, which grants kids access to thousands of children’s books and audiobooks for free. After that, though, you’ll have to $79 per year (or $48 with Amazon Prime).\nThe base Kindle doesn’t have extra conveniences like the waterproofing you’ll find in the entry-level Kobo Clara BW and Paperwhite. You also don’t get the physical page-turning buttons found on Barnes & Noble’s entry-level e-reader, the Nook GlowLight 4e (though the Kindle is a lot snappier than the Nook). And because it’s an Amazon ebook reader, you’re also locked into the Amazon ecosystem and have to pay extra to remove ads. But if you can do without that, the Kindle delivers the essentials for under $110.\nThe best ebook reader for taking notes\nKobo Elipsa 2E\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nIntuitive note-taking features\nGreat e-reader\nAdjustable warm light\nUseful note-taking capabilities, including handwriting-to-text conversion\n\nLacks native support for Kindle books\n227ppi display isn’t as sharp as the competition\nNo note-summarization features\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 at Amazon\n $399.99 at Target\n $399.99 at Rakuten Kobo\n\nDimensions: 7.6 x 8.94 x 0.30 inches / Weight: 390 grams / Screen area and resolution: 10.3-inches, 227ppi resolution / Storage: 32GB / Other features: Handwriting to text conversion, magnetic stylus, Bluetooth audio support \nOf all the large ebook readers I tested, the Kobo Elipsa 2E stood out the most because it’s a good e-reader with solid note-taking abilities. You can write directly on pages just as on a physical book. The Kindle Scribe lets you annotate book pages as well, but it’s complicated involving resizable text boxes that mess up the page formatting and prevent you from doing basic things like circling words. In contrast, taking notes on the Elipsa 2E feels far more intuitive and natural.\nThe Elipsa 2E offers other helpful note-taking tools and capabilities. Like the Kobo Libra Colour, it’s capable, for example, of solving math equations for you. You can also insert diagrams and drawings, and it’ll automatically snap them into something that looks cleaner and nicer. You can also sync your notes with Dropbox or view them online and convert handwriting to typed text. The Kindle Scribe offers the latter capability, too, but again, Kobo does it faster and better within the original notebook document as opposed to on a separate page. The only thing missing from the Elipsa 2E is the Scribe’s note-summarization feature, but that’s a trade-off I am okay with given how much easier it is to take notes.\nFinally, the Kobo Elipsa 2E comes with twice the storage (32GB) for the same price as the base Kindle Scribe. You can step up to the 32GB Kindle Scribe for $20 more or upgrade to 64GB for $40 extra. Yet given the Scribe’s limitations, I still recommend saving the money and buying the Kobo Elipsa 2E instead.\nNote-taking capabilities aside, the Kobo Elipsa 2E is also a good e-reader with the same strengths and weaknesses as other Kobo devices. There’s support for a wide range of file formats, but you can’t easily read Kindle books without converting them first. Its 227ppi display is also slightly less sharp than the 300ppi screen found on the Kindle Scribe and the Kobo Libra Colour. However, the 10.3-inch screen balances things out a bit and makes text easier to read, so it’s not a noticeable drawback. Plus, the Elipsa 2E comes with an adjustable warm light for nighttime reading.  That’s a feature rival e-readers with more advanced note-taking capabilities — including the $409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3, which lets you insert links to notes — lacks.\nOther ebook readers that didn’t make the cut\nThere are some other ebook readers my colleagues and I have tested that I didn’t feature above but are still worth highlighting. Here are the most notable:\nKindle Colorsoft Signature Edition\nThe Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is the first Kindle to feature E Ink’s color screen technology and it stands out from other color e-paper devices with customizations. It offers improved contrast, more vibrant colors, and faster screen refreshes. With a $279.99 price tag, it’s the most expensive Kindle model currently available that doesn’t support a stylus for note-taking, and it includes premium features like wireless charging that are convenient but not really necessary for a device with months of battery life. Amazon doesn’t offer a cheaper version of the Colorsoft like it does with the Paperwhite, which is available in standard and Signature Edition versions, but if you want a color screen and want to stick with Amazon, the Colorsoft is your best option. – Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter \nKobo Clara Colour\nIf you’re looking for a non-Amazon alternative that’s more affordable than the Kobo Libra Colour, the Kobo Clara Colour — the successor to the Kobo Clara 2E — is worth a look. At $139.99 $159.99, the ad-free e-reader costs more than the Kobo Clara 2E, but I think it’s worth the extra $10. It continues to offer the same six-inch display and IPX8 waterproof design, but the e-reader now offers color. Plus, it’s noticeably faster — something I was happy to see, considering the occasional lag on the Clara 2E sometimes got on my nerves. You don’t get the Clara Colour’s physical buttons or stylus support, but that’s a fair tradeoff at this price point.\nNook Glowlight 4 Plus\nIn 2023, Barnes and Noble released the Nook Glowlight 4 Plus. If you own a lot of digital books from Barnes and Noble, this could be a good Kindle alternative. Otherwise, I’d still recommend the Kobo Libra Colour to everybody else. The $199.99 Nook Glowlight 4 Plus is a good e-reader with a lot to offer, including a lovely 300ppi screen, waterproofing, physical page-turning buttons, and even a headphone jack. However, it’s just not as snappy, which makes setting it up, buying books from the device itself, and navigating the interface a slow ordeal. It didn’t help that the screen sometimes froze, too, which meant I had to restart the device while in the middle of a book.\nBoox Palma 2\nDespite all the advantages of E Ink display technology, your smartphone is probably still a more convenient device for reading given how pocket-friendly it is. The Boox Palma 2 is a smartphone-sized E Ink device that’s just as easy to slip into a pocket, but with more capabilities than an e-reader. Its 6.3-inch E Ink display is great for reading books, but the $279.99 Palma 2 also runs Android 13 so you can install productivity apps like email and messaging — assuming you’ve got access to Wi-Fi, of course, because the compact e-reader lacks cellular connectivity. If you already have the original Palma, the sequel isn’t worth the upgrade. But if you’re looking for a smaller alternative to Kindles and Kobos, the Palma 2 could be worth the splurge. – Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter \nBoox Go 10.3\nThe $409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3 is another ad-free ebook reader you can use to take notes. It’s excellent as a note-taking device, and it offers an impressively wide range of writing tools and more prebuilt notebook templates than Kobo’s Elipsa 2E. Jotting down notes using the built-in notebook felt more akin to writing on paper as well, and its slim design makes the device feel more like a traditional notebook. Like all Boox devices, it also provides quick access to the Google Play Store, so you can download multiple reading apps — including both Kindle and Kobo apps. The slate’s crisp 300ppi display is sharper than that of the Kobo Elipsa 2E, too, which is a plus.\nHowever, in comparison to the easy-to-use Elipsa 2E, the Go 10.3 lacks a front light and comes with a steeper learning curve. Notes you take on a Kindle or Kobo device won’t transfer over (and vice versa), and you can’t annotate books in either app using the Boox. I also felt like access to Google Play can be a double-edged sword as it grants easy access to distracting apps, including games, streaming services, and TikTok. It’s too slow to use the latter, but it’s fast and comfortable enough that I found myself playing around with the Word Search app far too often. For me personally, I need my e-reader to be devoid of such distractions — it’s one of the biggest things that distinguishes it from a tablet, after all. But if you’ve got more self-control than I do, the Go 10.3 could be worth a look.\nBoox Go Color 7 Gen II\nIn April, Boox  introduced the Go Color 7 Gen II, which retails for $279.99. This water-resistant e-reader offers a 300ppi display that drops to 150ppi when displaying color content, much like its Kobo and Kindle rivals. However, similar to the Kobo Libra Colour, this ad-free model offers physical-page turning buttons and supports note-taking. A stylus isn’t included, so you’ll need to spend an extra $45.99 for Boox’s pressure-sensitive InkSense pen if you want to take notes. And, like other Boox devices, it runs on Android, giving you access to a wide range of apps and online bookstores through the Google Play Store.\nWhile I appreciated not having to sideload my Kindle and Kobo library, along with greater flexibility to fine-tune color settings, I ultimately prefer the Kobo Libra Colour. In my testing, the Go Color 7 Gen II felt frustratingly sluggish by comparison to the Libra Colour, which is disappointing given the Boox costs $50 more. Responsiveness is a core part of the reading experience for me, so I’d only recommend Boox’s model to readers who value having Android app flexibility over performance.\nWhat’s coming next\nIn July, Amazon announced a more affordable version of the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition: the Kindle Colorsoft. At $249.99, it’s $30 cheaper but comes with half the storage at 16GB. It also lacks wireless charging and an auto-adjusting front light, that latter of which can be very helpful for nighttime reading. Otherwise, it seems identical to the Signature Edition model. I’ve just gotten my hands on the e-reader, but I’ll let you know my impressions once I’ve spent more time testing it.\nUpdate, August 13th: Adjusted pricing and availability. Also, I added thoughts about the Boox Go Color 7 Gen II and mentioned the new 16GB Kindle Colorsoft model. Andrew Liszewski also contributed to this post.",

      "raw": "Google is rolling out an update for Gemini that will allow the AI chatbot to “remember” your past conversations without prompting. With the setting turned on, Gemini will automatically recall your “key details and preferences” and use them to personalize its output.\nThis expands upon an update that Google introduced last year, which lets you ask Gemini to “remember” your personal preferences and interests. Now, Gemini won’t need prompting to recall this information. As an example, Google says if you’ve used Gemini to get ideas for a YouTube channel surrounding Japanese culture in the past, then AI chatbot might suggest creating content about trying Japanese food if you ask it to suggest new video ideas in the future.\nA recent New York Times article connected ChatGPT’s introduction of cross-chat memory in April to an increase in reports of “delusional” chats, and last week, OpenAI said it was working on more safety guardrails to detect mental or emotional distress.\nWhen asked about this issue, Google spokesperson Elijah Lawal said Google is “constantly” trying to improve its safeguards. “Our focus has been building a personal AI assistant, and Gemini learning your preferences is key to this,” Lawal said. “Equally crucial is giving you easy controls to choose the experience that’s best for you, so you can turn this feature on and off at any time.”\nGoogle will turn on this feature by default, but you can disable it by heading to your settings in the Gemini app and selecting Personal Context. From there, toggle off the Your past chats with Gemini option. Google will roll out this feature to its Gemini 2.5 Pro model in “select countries” starting today, before eventually bringing it to more locations and its Gemini 2.5 Flash model.\nGoogle is making a change to its privacy settings, as well. In the “coming weeks,” Google will rename its “Gemini Apps Activity” setting to “Keep Activity.” When you enable this option, Google will use “a sample” of your file and photo uploads to Gemini to “help improve Google services for everyone” starting on September 2nd, according to its blog post. This setting is turned off by default, and Google notes that Your “Keep Activity” will also remain switched off if you’ve already disabled the “Gemini Apps Activity” setting.\nYou can also preserve privacy through a new “temporary chats” option in Gemini. Temporary chats won’t appear in your recent chats or your Keep Activity setting. Gemini also won’t use these chats to personalize future conversations, nor will Google use them to train its AI models. Google will only save these conversations for 72 hours. The says temporary chats could come in handy for “exploring private questions” or to prevent Gemini from referencing the details of the conversation in a future chat.",

It’s not as well-known as some of the other autonomous vehicle startups in the US and China. The company was founded in 2016 by former Princeton professor Jianxiong Xiao, a specialist in 3D learning, computer vision, and robotics (who also apparently goes by “Professor X,” according to LinkedIn). Since then, AutoX has nabbed several high-profile investors, including China’s Dongfeng Motor Group and e-commerce giant Alibaba.\nIn 2020, it partnered with Fiat Chrysler (now Stellantis) to launch a robotaxi service in China. In 2022, it opened a robotaxi operation center in San Francisco with the goal of launching a commercial service — though it has yet to obtain the appropriate permits to do so. For the permits it does have, the company appears to have filed its rebranded name with the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Tensor is one of only six companies, along with Waymo and Zoox, with a permit to test fully driverless vehicles on public roads in California.\nNow it appears to be pivoting from robotaxis to “robocars.” Tensor says its vehicle is “the first and only L4 autonomous vehicle available for personal ownership.” It says it will launch in the US, Europe, and the Middle East starting in 2026. \n“When the world shifts… how will you move?” said Amy Luca, chief marketing officer at Tensor, in a press release. “We are building a world where individuals own their personal AGI agents, enhancing freedom, privacy and autonomy. With Tensor, we’re introducing the world’s first personal Robocar, ushering in the era of AI defined vehicles. This isn’t a car as we know it. It’s an embodied personal agent that moves you.” (Luca is the former executive vice president and head of social at Monks, a marketing firm based in London, according to her LinkedIn.)\n\n“When the world shifts… how will you move?” \n\n\nIn using buzz words associated with companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, Tensor appears to be trying to insert itself into the hype-strewn world of chatbots and artificial general intelligence. After all, autonomous vehicles are so last decade.\nTensor’s robocar appears to be no slouch, either. It comes with an array of high-tech sensors, including “37 cameras, 5 lidars, 11 radars, 22 microphones, 10 ultrasonic sensors, 3 IMUs, GNSS, 16 collision detectors, 8 water-level detectors, 4 tire-pressure sensors, 1 smoke detector, and triple-channel 5G.” Of course, those sensors won’t be cheap, though Tensor did not put a price on its future robocar. \nSeveral companies have designs to sell privately owned autonomous vehicles, but none have achieved that milestone. Tesla CEO Elon Musk keeps promising that the “unsupervised” version of the company’s Full Self-Driving feature is just around the corner, but he has yet to deliver. GM has also said that it will eventually sell fully driverless cars to customers. But there remains a thicket of cost and liability concerns that will need to be ironed out before any company can take that next step.\nUpdate August 13th: After the publication of this article, Tensor spokesperson Lena Allen responded with a statement about the brand’s relationship to AutoX, and AutoX’s relationship to China:\nSince its founding in 2016 in San Jose, Auto X has been an American company. Its new consumer brand, Tensor, is also headquartered in San Jose, California, with satellite offices in Spain, the UAE, and Singapore. Tensor focuses on the US, EU, and the GCC markets. As an independent private California startup, they’re controlled by their U.S. employees, with significant majority investment/ownership from the UK, Japan, Korea and US. In 2018, Auto X launched their autonomous delivery service in San Jose for over 1000 self-driving delivery orders, operating until Covid lockdown. In 2020, Auto X received the second-ever driverless AV testing permit in California.\nIn 2019, AutoX entered the China market as a foreign company in China. We managed to obtain local self-driving test permits alongside with other foreign companies, such as BMW, Tesla, and VW. During the pandemic lockdowns in the U.S., we launched a fully driverless robotaxi fleet in China. However, starting several years ago, AutoX began winding down its China operations; all operations under the AutoX brand in China have been divested, with all offices closed and operations shut down. The AutoX brand and its China operations have been fully discontinued.\nWe have evolved into the Tensor brand to better reflect our renewed focus on delivering personalized, private, and autonomous technology for individual ownership.",

A new study published this week found that doctors who frequently use AI to detect cancer in one medical procedure got significantly worse at doing so. \nThe researchers set out to discover whether continuous exposure to AI impacted doctors’ behavior when conducting colonoscopy, so they decided to assess “how endoscopists who regularly used AI performed colonoscopy when AI was not in use.”\nThe answer: Not so hot. The rate was about six percentage points lower. \nThe study was published in The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology journal by medical professionals and researchers in countries including Poland, Norway, Sweden, the U.K., and Japan. It followed doctors at four endoscopy centers in Poland, which were part of a trial program focusing on AI’s use in colonoscopy for potential cancer prevention.\nIt raises questions about the use of AI in healthcare, when it helps and when it could hurt. Last week, The Verge reported on a Google healthcare AI model’s instance of potentially hallucinating a body part and where medical professionals think the industry will go from here.",
