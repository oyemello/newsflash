      "raw": "AT&T is testing an AI-powered assistant designed to screen phone calls for you. The mobile carrier is bringing the feature to a select group of customers this year, and likens it to a “digital receptionist” that can identify and filter out robocallers based on the information from its network, like your call history.\n“This is only the foundation of what it can do,” Andy Markus, AT&T’s chief data officer, tells The Verge, adding that the AI assistant could eventually help you make reservations or schedule appointments in the future, similar to what you can do with Google’s AI assistant.\nWhen you receive a call from an unknown number, AT&T’s AI assistant will pick up and ask for more information about who’s calling and why. The AI assistant will patch the call through to you if it meets certain criteria, such as whether it determines the caller is human based on the sound of its voice or if it detects a sense of urgency. Otherwise, it can take a message or hang up.\nAT&T will use the information from its network to determine whether a caller is someone you interact with frequently, but you’ll also be able to put numbers on a “Do Not Screen” list, allowing calls from lesser-used numbers, like your doctor’s office or your child’s school, to go directly to you.\nMarkus says that building the AI agent directly into the carrier’s network is what helps make it stand out from other call-screening features, like those launched by Google and Apple. “Using the network, it understands the pattern that you as a consumer have,” Markus says. “Based on what we understand through the network, if my brother calls, we see that I interact with my brother all the time. Of course, that call should go through.”\nGoogle’s Call Screen feature, on the other hand, uses your phone’s contact list to determine if you know an incoming caller. It also detects spam based on what the caller says, as well as by comparing numbers against its database of known spammers and robocallers.\nBut AT&T’s on-network assistant doesn’t need a specific device to use the feature. AT&T will also let you see the AI assistant’s transcript in real time from its app, allowing you to keep tabs on the conversation while it happens. You can pick up the call at any time, or let the AI assistant handle it and provide an AI-generated summary of what it gathered.",

      "raw": "Aurzen’s D1R Cube projector trades Google TV for Roku TV. | Image: Roku\t\n\nAurzen has announced a new portable projector that will be the first to run the Roku TV OS already found on TVs from brands like TCL and Hisense. The new Aurzen D1R Cube will have access to popular streaming apps like Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon Prime, plus Roku Originals and over 500 FAST live channels.\nThe D1R Cube is available starting today for $169.99 through Amazon and Aurzen’s online store in gray, white, and green color options. Alongside the $299 tri-fold Zip, the Cube will be one of Aurzen’s most aggressively priced projectors. But its limited capabilities will potentially make it better suited as a portable solution for bringing movie night along on your next camping trip instead of the centerpiece of your home theater setup.\nAurzen says the Cube is capable of projecting an image up to 150 inches in size. With just 330 ANSI lumens of brightness, though, you’ll want a reflective screen and a completely dark room to avoid an image that’s dim or washed-out. For comparison, the Soundcore Nebula X1 Pro projector that Anker announced at IFA 2025 boasts 3,500 ANSI lumens of brightness. And while the Cube does support 4K content, it only displays it at 1080p.\nDespite its budget-minded pricing, the D1R Cube includes features like automatic focus and keystone adjustments for easier setup, 5W built-in speakers located on either side, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth for connecting the projector to louder wireless speakers or headphones. It also supports Apple AirPlay so you can stream video and audio directly from your iPhone and iPad. You can use Roku’s mobile app as a remote control with voice commands, and Roku Smart Home lets you get notifications from other smart devices around your home, including access to live feeds from security cameras.\nThe majority of the all-in-one projectors available today, including models from Xgimi and Anker, feature Google TV. Although that OS provides access to a larger variety of apps (including games) when compared to Roku TV, many entry-level projectors running Google TV have not been certified to natively access Netflix, requiring additional hardware like a dongle to use one of the most popular streaming apps. Roku TV provides not only that app but access to a lot of subscription-free content, including FAST channels and the library from the defunct streaming platform Quibi, which Roku acquired in early 2021.",

The good news is that Apple Sports now has an iOS widget that can be used on your homescreen. The bad news is that you can’t use it in iOS 26’s new CarPlay widgets feature.\nThe Apple Sports widget shows upcoming fixtures for your favorite teams, or live scores if your team is currently playing a game. It’s now one of the only free sports apps on iOS that incorporates all of Apple’s latest features, including Live Activities support for seeing scores on your lockscreen or in CarPlay, without ads getting in the way.\nI was really hoping Apple would make its widget work on the new iOS 26 CarPlay widgets panel, particularly because Apple Sports supports a wide variety of sports and not just soccer. While I could use iOS 26’s new Live Activities feature in CarPlay, it’s only available in the CarPlay Dashboard, and not inside the new widgets panel.\nThe new widgets panel is great homescreen-like interface for CarPlay, and it’s far less cluttered than the typical dashboard UI. I could also use third-party apps like FotMob, but that’s limited to just soccer when I want to see tennis, Formula 1, and other sports as well as the NFL and soccer.\nAlongside the new widget, Apple Sports is also getting more soccer with the addition of leagues including the Bundesliga 2, Ligue 2, Primeira Liga, Segunda División, and Serie B; other teams and leagues have also been added from Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.\nIf you have any good recommendations for sports apps on iOS that support Live Activities and CarPlay widgets, please respond in the comments section. I’m also looking out for any other interesting CarPlay widgets that are available thanks to iOS 26.",

      "raw": "Considering all the tech that we cover here at The Verge, you’d think that the members of our staff would be using their phones, laptops, and other gadgets for all their productivity needs. But interestingly, when we asked people to talk about their favorite productivity tools, there was suddenly an enthusiastic discussion of notebooks, pens, and dry-erase boards.\nWelcome to a not-so-secret society where members are concerned with the format of an analog notebook, the quality of its paper, and the available add-ons. Where article ideas, family activities, and interviews notes are jotted down rather than typed. And where productivity can be enhanced not by software, but rather by finding the right type of writing implement to use with your chosen notebook.\nCurious? Here are some of the analog productivity tools that we use here at The Verge. They aren’t our only tools — let’s face it, this is The Verge, after all — but they work for us, so they might work for you, too.\nHobonichi Techo Cousin day book\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $40 at Hobonichi\n $64.5 at Amazon\n\nAfter years of experimenting with every to-do app on the planet, I’ve gone back to my analog ways with the Hobonichi Techo — the A5 Cousin and the smaller Hobonichi Weeks. Something about physically writing my stuff with a pen helps me keep track of what’s truly worth my time and what isn’t. \nThe Cousin is great for visualizing my time on a yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily basis. The Weeks version is what I use for both gratitude journaling and tracking my self-care, fitness, and reading. Both books have some extra pages in back for commonplace journaling (aka writing down random knowledge, brain dumps, reference notes, etc.). There’s also a smaller A6 size, if these are too large or skinny. All Hobonichi books have a dot-grid format, and the Tomoe River paper is so thin — but it takes a significant amount of ink to bleed through. I’ve been using these notebooks for almost two years now, and while they’re on the pricier end (especially if you buy them directly from Hobonichi, which is based in Japan, and have to add on shipping costs), they’ve absolutely helped me become a much more productive person and better writer. —Victoria Song, senior reviewer\nTriangle Notebook\n \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $33 at Tan Mavitan Studio\n $33 at Amazon\n\nSidekick Notebook\n \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $24 at Tan Mavitan Studio\n $24 at Amazon\n\nThese seem more like art experiments than functional notebooks, but I love objects that make you rethink how you should use them. I typically have Post-it notes or a spiral notebook on my desk so I can write something down or doodle during a meeting. The L-shaped Sidekick doesn’t take up a ton of space on my desk, opened or closed. The Triangle Notebook is actually great for using on your lap or other unconventional surfaces, as it is pretty sturdy and lays flat on its spine. Both notebooks also encourage me to use my handwriting more, which was a New Year’s resolution I had. —Andru Marino, senior producer\nCirca Leather Discbound Notebook\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $149.5 at Amazon (letter-sized)\n $129.5 $95.5 at Levenger (letter-sized)\n\nWhile I have a tendency to be constantly looking for different apps to use for either taking notes or tracking tasks, I have to admit that over the years I’ve gotten more use out of a simple notebook with removable pages than Notion, Keep, or Evernote. Sold by Levenger under the Circa name, the notebooks are bound with plastic discs that let you easily remove and replace the pages. I’ve got a red leather notebook in the Compact size, which is just large enough to write comfortably in, but small enough to fit into my bag. (There are several sizes, ranging from the very small Jotlet to the considerably larger Letter.) Plastic tabs divide the pages into sections; my usual habit is to just open to the first empty page, grab my pen from the attached loop, and write. Later, I can move the page to the appropriate section, remove it for storage, or dispose of it if I don’t need it anymore. \nIt’s not a perfect system — I often have to remind myself to go through the notebook and dispose of outdated notes. (Also, the Compact size often seems to sell out.) But when I need to quickly jot down a thought, grabbing the Circa from my bag is faster than typing something out on my phone, and a lot more private than recording it. —Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor\nTraveler’s Notebook\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $62.98 at Amazon\n $55 at Traveler’s Company (various sizes)\n\nAbout a decade ago, my mother bought me a fauxdori (a knockoff Traveler’s Notebook) for Christmas. At first I didn’t quite get it (I already had more than enough journals and notebooks). But then I discovered that the Traveler’s Notebook wasn’t just a notebook, but a whole system of notebooks — and it’s now indispensable to me. There are a ton of different inserts that you can mix and match to suit your needs, from regular dot-grid notebooks to dated planners, and even thick, accordion-fold paper for watercolor panoramas. \nAfter some experimenting, I settled on a system that works for me. First, I have a Weekly + Memo insert where I can put all my important appointments and dates on the left-hand page, and use the grid on the right-hand page as a habit tracker, to-do list for the week, and a scratchpad for when I need to jot something down. Then I have a dot-grid journal where I, you know, journal. Rounding out the setup is a lined insert that is a sort of commonplace book for me to take notes on things I’m reading and collect ideas for articles or songs. I also have a sketchbook that I add in sometimes when I’m feeling arty, but things get a bit chunky with four inserts. \nMaybe you don’t need a separate journal and are content to put a single-sentence recap for each day in your planner. Maybe the memo area isn’t essential and a monthly planner insert will suffice. Or perhaps you want to go all in on scrapbooking and get an insert that’s all brown kraft paper. That’s the beauty of the Traveler’s Notebook: it’s whatever you want it to be. —Terrence O’Brien, weekend editor\nLAMY Safari Fountain Pen\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $37 at LAMY\n $20 at Walmart\n $22.02 at Amazon\n\nWhen I decided to try journaling again (with the aforementioned Traveler’s Notebook) I hoped to make the habit stick this time by making it a luxury experience. Scribbling with a Pilot G2 in whatever branded swag notebook I had laying around wasn’t working. So I decided to invest in a fountain pen. There was no need for me to immediately jump to a $200 pen, but I also wanted something nicer than a $3 disposable Zebra Zensations. I quickly settled on a Lamy Safari (admittedly in part because I found a limited-edition in a gorgeous terracotta orange) and haven’t looked back. I’ve tried a few other fountain pens since, but I keep coming back to the reliable and affordable Safari. \nThey’re only $30 each, which means you can build a small collection in a variety of colors for pretty cheap. I keep one with my Traveler’s Notebook at all times and one lives in my sling permanently alongside a Field Notes for when I want to travel light. Then I have a third that just lives on my desk. Basically, I am never without a fine writing instrument, and rarely have to resort to the scratchy collection of free pens that have overtaken an entire drawer in my office. That’s important since, if I actually enjoy writing with a pen, I’m far more likely to use it to take notes, update my to-do list, and journal. It makes those things pleasurable experiences, not just a chore. —Terrence O’Brien, weekend editor\nPlatinum Preppy Fountain Pen\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $6.74 $6.05 at Amazon\n $7 at Blick\n\nI get a small burst of dopamine every time I pop the top of my fountain pen and draw ink across a page. As a casual dabbler in fine art, writing with a fountain pen serves as my small way to make something pretty while also working a job that does not pay me to draw. I’ve tried other pens, like Muji’s multicolored 0.38 pens, Pigma Micron fine-tipped felt pens, and various gel pens with satisfying clicks. But fountain pens are my daily pleasure. \nMy love has not quite turned into an obsession. I use a Platinum Preppy fountain pen that costs under $10, and I refill the ink cartridge with Waterman ink using a needle that my friend, who is a nurse, gave to me. But I could see myself expanding this into a hobby by daring to try different color inks and, one day, visiting a nibmeister to get a nib ground to perfectly match the slant of my handwriting. In the meantime, I’ll enjoy my fairly basic, straightforward fountain pen for what it is: a good way to write a nice line on paper. — Elissa Welle, AI fellow\nZebra Sarasa Clip Gel Retractable pen\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $15.2 at Zebra (8-pack)\n $14.32 $8.9 at Amazon (8-pack)\n\nI’ve tried digital productivity tools for notes and reminders, but I find I remember things better when I write them by hand. I tend to prefer Japanese-made stationery, and I am very particular about the pens I use. For when a fountain pen feels like overkill, my favorite gel-ink ballpoint pen is Zebra’s Sarasa Clip, which comes in a variety of tip sizes. I like 0.5mm for basic note-taking and journaling and 0.4mm or 0.3mm for finer details, like when I need to write small or attempt to write kanji.\nThe Sarasa line of pens writes incredibly smoothly and vividly, with a noticeable edge over similar ballpoint pens, like Pilot’s G2 (or, god forbid, a Bic pen). I don’t ever find myself having to scribble on scrap paper to get the Sarasa pens going, which is probably my biggest pet peeve with other pens, and it’s easy to get ink refills on Amazon. In my experience, the ink dries quickly on the page, but there’s also the Sarasa Mark On, a smudge- and water-resistant version, for the lefties out there. For day-to-day writing, I simply will not use any other pen. — Kallie Plagge, senior copy editor\nBlackwing One-Step Long Point Sharpener\nFeatures a German steel blade for sharp pencil tips.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $25 at Blackwing\n $25 at Amazon\n\nThe Blackwing One-Step Long Point Sharpener is just such a nice little object. It’s reassuringly weighty while still light enough to carry every day. It has one job: it sharpens pencils beautifully. When the blade gets dull I can order a replacement from Blackwing, and I appreciate a little gadget with a lot of life. You do have to apply a bit of pressure to really get it sharp, and sometimes that creates kind of an indented ring on the pencil wood just above the point. Maybe that’s why people use two-stage sharpeners? I don’t know, I’m new to the luxury pencil game. If so, I think it’s an acceptable tradeoff for one-step sharpening. —Allison Johnson, senior reviewer\nLetterfolk Block Compact Monthly Calendar\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $116 at Letterfolk\n\nFor reasons I have yet to figure out, I have bounced off of every kind of tool, routine, and method out there for jotting down notes that can keep me accountable. Online tools are typically overly complex for me to grasp and easy to forget about, and I’ve just never taken to a journal or Post-it notes.\nSomething that’s working for me is a weekly calendar dry-erase board that’s in our kitchen. The one we use from Letterfolk has sections for every day of the week (Letterfolk only makes the monthly version now), plus a sidebar that can be customized to our needs. It also includes magnetized letters and numbers we have to swap out, which is kind of a fun, tactile experience. Whenever my wife and I are feeling overwhelmed, which is frequently, updating the board to reflect what we need can make us feel a little better, whether that’s sorting out what extra food we need for meals, writing out upcoming appointments, or discussing child care. The board doesn’t solve every woe in our lives, and updating it can be a chore in and of itself, but it’s a simple way to make life feel a little more orderly. —Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor",

      "raw": "Meta’s next big Connect conference is nearly here, and this year, we’re expecting to see a lot of news about glasses. AI-focused hardware is all the rage, and Meta arguably already has the best gadgets around in its Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses. At this year’s show, we’re expecting to see more about glasses, but also some standalone AI updates and even some talk of the metaverse.\nHere’s what we’re expecting from Connect, which will feature a keynote from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that we’ll be covering live on Wednesday at 8PM ET / 5PM PT.\nSmart glasses with a display and a wristband\nMeta plans to announce new smart glasses with a small display in the right lens that can be controlled with hand gestures via a wristband, CNBC reports. The display apparently has a limited field of view and is only intended to show small pieces of information. The Verge reported on the glasses, codenamed Hypernova, in 2022.\nThe wristband will apparently use surface electromyography (sEMG) technology that “reads and interprets the electrical signals from hand movements,” according to CNBC. The tech comes from CTRL-Labs, a startup Meta acquired in 2019, and Meta demoed it last year with its augmented reality Orion glasses. Meta is very optimistic about sEMG technology; in a recent blog post, it said that “sEMG could revolutionize how we interact with our devices” and that sEMG “may just prove to be the perfect input for virtually any device.”\nThe new glasses are expected to cost “about $800,” CNBC says, and could be thicker and heavier than some of Meta’s other smart glasses offerings. And a now-removed video from Meta caught by UploadVR actually showed a pair of new glasses with a display with the branding “Meta | Ray-Ban” and “Display,” so it seems like Meta is on the cusp of actually launching these.\nSmart glasses without a display\nMeta’s smart glasses have been a big success — EssilorLuxottica, which produces the Ray-Ban Metas, said that the company has sold 2 million pairs of the glasses — and rumors indicate that Meta could introduce new models at Connect.\nCNBC reports that Meta plans to announce third-generation Ray-Ban Metas. The timing would make some sense. Meta launched the previous-generation Ray-Bans about two years ago, and this year’s Oakley Meta HSTN Limited Edition glasses have a better 3K video resolution and double the battery life, so perhaps Meta will bring some of those improvements over to the Ray-Ban line.\nThe Meta video spotted by UploadVR also showed off a pair of new wraparound “Sphaera” Oakleys with a camera on the nose bridge, so it seems like those could show up at Connect, too.\nNew Quest VR headsets? We’ll see\nMeta released the Quest 3 in 2023 and the Quest 3S in 2024, but it doesn’t seem like we should expect a new Quest at Connect this year. According to UploadVR, Meta is working on an ultra-light headset that offloads the compute to a puck that runs the company’s Horizon OS, but the headset isn’t scheduled for release until 2026. \nMeta has also started licensing Horizon OS to hardware companies like Lenovo and Asus, and a rumor from earlier this year indicated that Asus is developing a VR headset codenamed Tarius with eye tracking and face tracking. Should that headset be real, it could debut at Connect.\nThe company is promising that Zuckerberg will touch on the metaverse in some way, so we’ll have to wait and see what that actually means.\nMore Meta AI\nMeta, like most tech companies, is obsessed with AI right now, so it seems likely the company will tout AI features coming to its apps and hardware. Meta recently relaunched its companion app for its smart glasses as a standalone Meta AI app that lets you browse AI-generated creations posted by other users, and Meta could further build out its social features. The company has also continued to add AI tools to its smart glasses, so in addition to brand-new hardware, existing hardware could get some AI-focused upgrades.",

      "raw": "Nothing’s Android-based Phone 3.\t\n\nLondon-based consumer tech startup Nothing has raised $200 million and vowed to usher in a new generation of “AI-native” devices running on operating systems that “are significantly different from the ones today.”\nIn a press release that reads part ode to technology and part manifesto, Nothing founder and CEO Carl Pei said the cash infusion — which values Nothing at $1.3 billion — will help the company ramp up distribution and accelerate innovation. \nAt the heart of Nothing’s plans is AI. Pei said the company is “building the foundations for the future” on a focused “AI OS” to deliver a “hyper-personalized experience.” However, it’s unclear if Nothing’s operating system ambitions are built on top of Android like Nothing OS. We’ve reached out for clarification.\nThis “AI-native platform” will run hardware in widespread use today like smartphones, headphones, and smart watches, Pei said, as well as other devices like smart glasses, electric vehicles, and humanoid robots. He confidently predicts Nothing’s new OS will run “whatever comes next,” too. That said, last October Pei just as confidently proclaimed that “AI is just a tool” and that the company’s OS should not be described as an AI operating system.\nNothing plans to release its first AI-native devices next year. Its chief challenge will be generating demand in a category that has historically failed to engage the mass market and where success has eluded even the industry’s biggest players like Apple. There’s no shortage of competitors either, including the mysterious “screen free” device former Apple designer Jony Ive is creating with OpenAI. \nNothing says it’s uniquely positioned to create these future AI devices. “Owning the last-mile distribution point with all its contextual and user knowledge is essential to developing an OS that will help people in their daily lives,” said Pei. “An AI OS that doesn’t know its user and isn’t ever-present can’t deliver a hyper-personalised experience. This is the next chapter for Nothing, integrating an AI experience into our hardware devices to reinvent how technology amplifies us.”",

The updated app will now list games from Steam, Battle.net, and other PC storefronts — making it a launcher for games you have installed on your PC.\nMicrosoft has been testing this aggregated library in recent months with Xbox Insiders, but it’s now available to all Xbox PC app users. It’s designed primarily for the new fullscreen Xbox experience that will ship on the Xbox Ally devices, but it’s also part of Microsoft’s efforts to make the Xbox app on Windows the home of PC gaming.\n“When you install a game from a supported PC storefront, it automatically appears in ‘My Library’ within the Xbox PC app, as well as the ‘Most Recent’ list of titles in the sidebar, so you can jump back into your favorite games with just a click,” explains Jason Beaumont, vice president of experiences at Xbox.\nAlongside the library integration, Microsoft is also rolling out a new My Apps section in the Xbox PC app that allows PC gamers to quickly install and launch third-party apps like browsers, gaming utilities, and rival storefronts. This new feature is also designed primarily for handhelds, to help people download and launch games from multiple stores.\nLater this month, Microsoft will also add cloud-playable games and game history to the Xbox app that syncs your recent games list on Xbox consoles, PC, or handheld. Microsoft already started rolling this out on Xbox consoles last month. “Once this feature is released, look for the ‘Jump back in’ list on the Home screen of your console, PC, or handheld to find your recent play history and pick up where you left off,” says Beaumont.",
