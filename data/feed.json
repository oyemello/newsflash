They were on the verge of dying, but its pair of retractable USB-C cables powered up my devices so I could keep working remotely. Since then, I carry it with me wherever I go, and it’s bailed me out time and again. If you need a powerful, portable charger, you can buy it for $94.49 ($25 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and directly from Anker with code WS7DV2RO9DEU, which is about $7 shy of its all-time low.\nAnker 25,000mAh Laptop Power Bank\nAnker’s latest power bank sports three USB-C ports, plus one USB-A port. It tops out at 165W when charging two devices simultaneously, or 130W when charging three or four.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $119.99 $94.49 at Amazon\n $119.99 $94.49 at Best Buy\n $119.99 $94.49 at Anker (with code WS7DV2JSRCFW)\n\nThis power bank is equipped with three USB-C ports, each capable of delivering up to 100 watts of power when only one 100W-ready device is plugged in. It can provide up to 165W of power when two devices are plugged in via USB-C, or up to 130W when you’ve got up to four devices plugged in. Anker also includes a USB-A port, which is handy for those who own older devices. During the aforementioned power outage, it simultaneously powered my MacBook, smartphone, and even a USB-C-powered flashlight, bringing my tech back to life in just a couple of minutes. \nWhat I also liked is that Anker includes a useful digital display that helps you keep tabs of remaining charge, battery health, and per-port power output. And, while the 25,000mAh / 90Wh power bank is a bit on the heavier side, it’s compliant with airline carry-on regulations, meaning you can safely take it to top up your gadgets during a flight. It’s a helpful gadget to have on hand, whether you’re working from a cafe, traveling, or stuck in the middle of a blackout.\nA couple more ways to save\nWoot’s selling the Samsung’s Galaxy 3 Buds for $74.99, down from $179.99. Samsung’s entry-level earbuds reminded us of the AirPods Pro with their angular stemmed design and gesture-based controls. The open-style earbuds also offer solid noise cancellation along with an IP57 rating and wireless charging support. Read our hands-on impressions.\nYou can buy Metaphor: ReFantazio for Xbox Series X from Woot for $21.99, down from $69.99. The medieval-era, turn-based RPG from the creators of Persona delivers a well-written story that explores themes of discrimination with nuance, while offering beautiful visuals and engaging combat.

Along with a more colorful, bubbly look, Material 3 Expressive introduces more personalization options, like iPhone-like calling cards that allow you to create custom call screens for your contacts.\nIn addition to this rollout, Google is bringing a bunch of new features to the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which it previewed during its Made by Google event last month. That includes Adaptive Audio, a feature that automatically adjusts volume based on the sounds in your environment, as well as a new capability that automatically dampens sudden loud noises to protect your hearing. The update adds background noise reduction when interacting with Gemini as well, and the ability to accept or ignore calls by nodding or shaking your head.\nGoogle will also start automatically displaying Maps on your Pixel Watch or WearOS device when you start walking or biking navigation on your phone, allowing you to easily see where you’re going without taking out your phone. These Pixel-specific updates are rolling out now, and “will continue over the next few weeks.”\nSome other tweaks are coming to a wider range of Android devices, too, including the ability to share Bluetooth audio with friends, access AI-powered writing suggestions in Gboard, and favorite your creations in Emoji Kitchen. There’s a redesigned Quick Share menu that lets you toggle between sending and receiving files, and a new Androidify app that uses AI to create your own Android bot using a selfie and a prompt.",

      "raw": "If you ever doubted the “console wars” were over, here’s a new piece of data to consider: Helldivers 2, formerly console exclusive to Sony’s PS5, is currently the best-selling title on Xbox. In fact, it’s the first and third best-selling game, if you count its more premium edition, and it’s currently the ninth-most played game on the platform — mostly beaten by free-to-play games like Fortnite and Roblox but also Minecraft and GTA V. \nIt doesn’t surprise me that Helldivers 2 is popular on Xbox, because it was a huge hit on PS5 and PC. Last May, Sony revealed that Helldivers 2 had become PlayStation’s fastest-selling game of all time with 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, and it may have now crossed 18 million after reportedly racking up nearly a million on Xbox in its first week on sale.\nNo, what’s surprising is that we now live in an era where companies like Sony and Microsoft no longer entirely see their hit games as a way to get players to buy their own consoles, and instead just want to sell as many copies of these games as they can. Back in May, we wrote about how the top three games on PlayStation came from Microsoft, and now it’s reciprocal! \nSony has come around to this position slowly, but by 2022, it planned for roughly half of its games to come out on PC or mobile instead of just console, and though PlayStation game boss Hermen Hulst suggested in 2024 that some of Sony’s big single-player games might be held in reserve, the company revealed this August that it’s gradually “moving away from a hardware centric business model.” It’s about selling games, not consoles. \nHere’s where some of you will no doubt point out: is Helldivers 2 actually a PlayStation game? Since PlayStation is merely the publisher and doesn’t own its developer Arrowhead Game Studios, is it really such a big deal? \nI would say yes, because Sony has been the one in control, the one making the strategic decisions over when and where and how much PlayStation goodness to share. When players balked at how Helldivers 2 originally required you to log in with a PlayStation account on PC, it was out of Arrowhead’s hands. When players wanted an Xbox version, Arrowhead said it was entirely up to Sony. \nMicrosoft doesn’t have to cut such publishing deals to bring Xbox’s biggest games to PlayStation, though. When it chose to bring Indiana Jones and Hellblade 2 to PS5, it could do so because it owns both giant publisher / developer Bethesda and developer Ninja Theory itself.\nWhat is an Xbox, and what is a PlayStation, if not the place to play specific games? Is it a launcher and a set of familiar controls? Is it a feeling? That’s the challenge facing Microsoft and Sony if they continue down this road.",

In a press release sent to The Verge, Aylo says the settlement doesn’t introduce “any new substantive requirements that were not either already in place or in progress.”\nPornhub has long struggled with content moderation, but things came to a head in 2020, when The New York Times published a report detailing the presence of CSAM and NCM on Pornhub, leading Visa and Mastercard to stop processing payments on the site.

      "raw": "The aptly-named Max Headphones Charging Stand is specifically designed for Apple’s flagship headphones. | Image: Mophie\t\n\nMophie has announced a new wireless charger for Apple’s AirPods Max called the Max Headphones Charging Stand. The AirPods Max don’t support wireless charging, so Mophie’s new stand relies on a small dongle that stays connected to the headphones’ USB-C port at all times. When docked in the stand, the dongle magnetically aligns and connects to charging pins that deliver power to the battery while additional magnets in the cradle put the headphones into sleep mode.\nThe Max Headphones Charging Stand is available now through Mophie’s online store for $150, and includes a dongle compatible with the USB-C version of the AirPods Max that Apple introduced a year ago. The company currently has no plans to introduce a Lightning connector version of the dongle that would make the stand compatible with older versions of the AirPods Max.\nThe stand features a weighted base made from anodized aluminum, while the cradle that supports the AirPods Max earcups is made from soft-touch silicone so it won’t scratch the headphones’ finish.\nAlthough it’s a more convenient way to keep the AirPods Max charged when not in use (they only go into their battery-saving sleep mode when placed in their case) the stand is another accessory demanding precious desktop real estate. To help further justify the splurge, Mophie includes a second Qi-compatible pad on the base for wirelessly charging your AirPods earbuds or a smartphone, but there’s no mention of Qi2.2 or even Qi2 support, so don’t expect fast charging speeds or the convenience of magnets there.",
