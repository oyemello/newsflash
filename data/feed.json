The story already seemed highly unlikely, and on Monday afternoon, Tesla tweeted about the video, saying, ‚ÄúThis is fake ‚Äì that‚Äôs not our screen. Tesla does NOT disable vehicles remotely.‚Äù\nOn Sunday, Instagram user @bighuey313 posted a video of his supposed deactivated Cybertruck, complete with a flashing red warning message on the truck‚Äôs main touchscreen. ‚ÄúDog wtf my cybertruck just shut off on the freeway! üò°‚Äù he wrote in the caption. ‚ÄúAlmost just crashed wtf¬†@teslamotors.‚Äù\nThe owner also posted an image of what he claimed was a cease-and-desist letter from Tesla‚Äôs vice president of legal affairs, Dinna Eskin. The letter cites ‚Äúunauthorized use of Tesla‚Äôs intellectual property in musical content distributed under your name.‚Äù \nThe video quickly went viral on BlueSky, where anti-Elon Musk sentiment has helped fuel nationwide protests against Tesla. But users quickly noticed a number of discrepancies, such as the fact that the letter opens ‚ÄúWe represent Tesla‚Äù despite being signed by the company‚Äôs in-house counsel. The letter also uses Eskin‚Äôs old title, ‚ÄúSr. Director and Deputy General Counsel,‚Äù despite her current title of VP. And the warning message isn‚Äôt formatted like Tesla‚Äôs typical in-vehicle alerts and notifications. An X user speculated that the flashing red title was likely just a YouTube video playing on fullscreen to simulate a legitimate error. \nDespite these issues, the video went viral on BlueSky, X, and Reddit ‚Äî and likely will continue to travel far and wide, confirming many people‚Äôs prior opinions about Tesla and Elon Musk. \nUpdate August 11th: Tesla posted on X confirming the video is fake.",

Claude searches past chats to read and summarize them for the user, then asks if they‚Äôd like to move on and keep working on the same project.\n‚ÄúNever lose track of your work again,‚Äù the company wrote. ‚ÄúClaude now remembers your past conversations, so you can seamlessly continue projects, reference previous discussions, and build on your ideas without starting from scratch every time.‚Äù \n\nThe feature works across web, desktop, and mobile, and it can keep different projects and workspaces separate. It started rolling out to Claude‚Äôs Max, Team, and Enterprise subscription tiers today ‚Äî just go to ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù under ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù and switch the feature on under ‚ÄúSearch and reference chats‚Äù ‚Äî and the company said other plans should receive access soon.\nBut there‚Äôs an important caveat here: It‚Äôs not yet a persistent memory feature like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. Claude will only retrieve and reference your past chats when you ask it to, and it‚Äôs not building a user profile, according to Anthropic spokesperson Ryan Donegan.\nAnthropic and OpenAI have been going head-to-head in the AI arms race for quite a while, racing to roll out competing features and functionalities ‚Äî¬†like voice modes, larger context windows, and new subscription tiers ‚Äî as they both raise ever-increasing funding amounts. Last week, OpenAI launched GPT-5, and Anthropic is currently looking to close a round that could value it as high as $170 billion.\nMemory functions are another way leading AI companies are looking to attract and keep users on one chatbot service, increasing ‚Äústickiness‚Äù and user engagement.\nChatbots‚Äô memory functions have been the subject of online debate in recent weeks, as ChatGPT has been both lauded and lambasted for its references to users‚Äô past conversations, with some users controversially treating it as a therapist and others experiencing mental health struggles that some are referring to as ‚ÄúChatGPT psychosis.‚Äù",

There are discounts on the company‚Äôs impressive tablets, but the highlights are the new low prices on its smartwatches. Right now, you can buy the 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 for $269.99 ($30 off), while the 46mm is $319.99 ($30 off). Even the OnePlus Watch 2 is cheaper than it‚Äôs ever been at $199.99 ($100 off). Students get an additional 10 percent off, making these deals even sweeter.\nWe‚Äôve recommended the OnePlus Watch 2 as a great alternative to Google and Samsung smartwatches since its debut, and the Watch 3 builds upon it with small, but meaningful upgrades. It retains everything we loved in its predecessor, like dual-frequency GPS and long battery life, but now adds Google Gemini, a rotating crown that scrolls, and video watch faces. The company also added its 60S Health Check-In, which provides a quick snapshot of your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (with European users also getting EKGs) with a click of a button.\nThe OnePlus Watch 3 comes in two sizes: a new 43mm model introduced in July, and a 46mm version released back in April. Both are similar in terms of specs, but the 43mm model skips the 46mm‚Äôs temperature sensor that was used for reproductive cycle tracking and fall detection. The 46mm wearable also boasts a larger, brighter 2,200-nit OLED display, which is double the brightness of the 43mm version (1000 nits).\nRead our hands-on impressions of the OnePlus Watch 3.\nOnePlus Watch 3\nThe OnePlus Watch 3 builds upon the OnePlus Watch 2 with a new 43mm size and rotating crown bezel.

      "raw": "The Switch 2 can be enjoyed right out of the box, but it‚Äôs even better with the right accessories. Some of these add-ons are more crucial than others, especially if you‚Äôre deciding what to buy early on. For example, a case and a screen protector can keep your console safe from scuffs, scratches, and drops, so both are what I‚Äôd consider to be essential. \nOn the other hand, a microSD Express card lets you add even more digital games to your library, although the console‚Äôs somewhat generous 256GB of internal storage means you may not need one right away. Some others don‚Äôt add enough to the gaming experience to be worth it. Those Joy-Con 2 steering wheel accessories? You can pass on those.\nThe Switch 2 and its games are expensive enough, so we‚Äôve assembled this guide with picks that are a great value. You don‚Äôt need to spend hundreds on accessories ‚Äî many of us at The Verge certainly aren‚Äôt. No matter your budget, we‚Äôve included numerous categories, beginning with a starter kit of recommendations we think everyone should consider.\nOur seven must-have Switch 2 accessories\namFilm OneTouch two-pack of glossy screen protectors\nThis two-pack of glossy screen protectors is a great value.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $15.99 $8.99 at Amazon\n\ntomtoc slim carrying case for the Switch 2\nA slim, durable case that comes in multiple color schemes.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $47.99 $33 at Amazon\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller\nThe Switch 2 wireless controller with the most features, but it‚Äôs not cheap.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $89 at Walmart\n $89.99 at Best Buy\n $89 at Amazon\n\n8BitDo USB Adapter 2\nGrab this to be able to use your Xbox or PS5 controller on your Switch 2.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $19.99 $18.99 at Amazon (with on-page coupon)\n $19.99 at 8BitDo\n $19.99 at Best Buy\n\nSandisk microSD Express card\nOnce you‚Äôve filled up the Switch 2‚Äôs built-in 256GB SSD, add some extra storage.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $53.99 at Amazon (128GB)\n $71.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $115.99 at Amazon (512GB)\n\nUgreen USB-C-to-ethernet adapter\nSwitch 2 Wi-Fi download speeds are painfully slow.

It‚Äôs similar in several ways to the excellent Pro controller that debuted alongside the Switch, especially in design, with its analog stick layout, and because it‚Äôs the most replete with features you won‚Äôt find on other Switch 2 gamepads.¬†\nIts motion control support isn‚Äôt a novel feature (many third-party controllers offer that), but its Amiibo NFC support is still something that almost no alternatives offer. Another feature that makes this one worth considering despite its high price is its 3.5mm headphone jack, in case you want to plug in a set of wired headphones for private listening. Additionally, it can wake the Switch 2 from standby via Bluetooth (only a select few wireless models possess this ability), so you don‚Äôt have to get off your couch to hit the console‚Äôs power button. Lastly, this model has two additional buttons that can be mapped to mimic almost any other button. (some cheaper alternatives, including the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 and Pro 3, feature four extra buttons).\nThe Switch 2 Pro is very comfortable, and it‚Äôs the controller that I always want to use when given the choice between the options below. But it‚Äôs not perfect. For one, it‚Äôs pricey at $89.99, and you‚Äôd think for that price Nintendo might have opted for drift-resistant sticks. Alas, you owe $5 to your buddy who bet that Nintendo would doggedly opt again for potentiometer sticks that are proven to tear down over time. Its sticks haven‚Äôt caused issues so far, but it‚Äôs possible that they might not fare as well ‚Äî and as long ‚Äî as models below that feature more durable Hall effect or TMR joysticks. \nRead our review of the Switch 2 Pro\nNintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller\nThe Switch 2 Pro Controller features new remappable ‚ÄúGL‚Äù and ‚ÄúGR‚Äù rear buttons, the ‚ÄúC‚Äù button to access in-game chat features, and a headphone jack.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $89 at Walmart\n $89.99 at Best Buy\n $89.99 at Target\n\n8BitDo Pro 3\n8BitDo‚Äôs Pro 3 is a good alternative to the Switch 2 Pro controller: it‚Äôs slightly cheaper, yet better in some ways (and a bit worse in others) that might matter to you.¬†\nStarting with the good, the company upgraded its joysticks to the even more durable TMR sensors. The two back paddles are carried over from the first iteration, though there‚Äôs a new pair of buttons (L4 and R4) near the triggers that can be customized. Also of note are new toggle switches around its backside (similar to what we saw on the DualSense Edge) that let you alter the travel distance of its two triggers. Toggling a switch makes the corresponding trigger feel more like a mouse click. \nIt‚Äôs also worth noting that this controller is significantly more customizable than the Switch 2 Pro, as well as most other controllers out there. Its face buttons are magnetically attached, and can be removed to let the Pro 3 flip between the Switch layout and the Xbox layout.\nWhile the Pro 3‚Äôs TMR sticks might make it last longer, there are some trade-offs compared to the pricier Nintendo alternative ‚Äî none of which are deal-breakers if saving money is a top priority. For example, its attempts to replicate the subtle blips and buzzing of Nintendo‚Äôs impressive HD haptics in the Switch 2 Pro controller are just not good. Its attempts at replicating the smallest, nuanced vibrations of Donkey Kong walking in Bananza makes it go full boar. I‚Äôd sooner turn off the vibration entirely than deal with how jarringly intense it feels, and thankfully you can in the app.\nOther downsides are more minor, but are still worth knowing about. It lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, and it doesn‚Äôt have the C button to launch GameChat. However, you can easily assign the feature to one of the Pro 3‚Äôs buttons via the Switch 2‚Äôs OS ‚Äî but not to its additional buttons (the two R buttons near the triggers, and the two rear paddles). If you‚Äôd prefer to use the controller‚Äôs built-in button combo to reassign in-game commands to any of its buttons, that‚Äôs easy to do, per the instructions in its PDF manual. \nRead our review of the 8BitDo Pro 3\n8BitDo Pro 3 controller\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 at Amazon\n\n8Bitdo USB Adapter 2\nIt‚Äôs technically not a controller, but I‚Äôm a broken record when it comes to recommending 8BitDo‚Äôs USB Adapter 2 for households already with more than one console. In the case that you have an Xbox or a PS5 and would rather not buy a bespoke Switch 2 controller, just buy this $20 adapter instead, and use it to connect a wireless controller you already own.\nThis adapter goes into the Switch 2‚Äôs dock (or directly into the console, if you have a USB-A to C adapter). Connecting your controller is as easy as putting it into pairing mode, then ensuring that the ‚ÄúPro Controller Wired Communication‚Äù option is turned on within the console‚Äôs settings. Click and hold the adapter‚Äôs coin-shaped button to initiate pairing, then you should be good to go. The DualSense‚Äôs rumble and motion controls work seamlessly, and you can remap buttons as you please within the console‚Äôs OS, just like you would an official Switch controller.\nBest adapter: 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2\nThe 8BitDo‚Äôs latest adapter resembles a flash drive, but once connected to your Switch‚Äôs dock, it allows you to wirelessly pair it with a variety of PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo controllers.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $19.99 $18.99 at Amazon (with on-page coupon)\n $19.99 at 8BitDo\n $19.99 at Best Buy\n\nBest Switch 2 cases\nDbrand Killswitch\nThe Killswitch is a great Switch 2 companion, whether you‚Äôre someone who primarily uses the console in handheld mode or while it‚Äôs docked. It‚Äôs a case that wraps around the Switch 2‚Äôs back, with detachable components that snugly grip onto each Joy-Con 2, adding some extra bulk that makes them more comfortable to hold. Above all else, it‚Äôs a great way to protect your console from scratches and slightly more significant damage. What‚Äôs also great is that it doesn‚Äôt limit its flexibility as a hybrid console.\nEach Killswitch ships with a USB-C dock adapter that is inserted into the Switch 2 dock. Since the case-equipped console can no longer fit in Nintendo‚Äôs dock, this adapter lets you connect it to your TV without taking off the case. It‚Äôs tougher to correctly align the Switch 2‚Äôs USB-C jack with this adapter than it is to put it in the dock, but it gets easier with practice. \nRead our review of the Dbrand Killswitch\nDbrand Killswitch ‚Äì Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 at Dbrand\n\nTomtoc FancyCase Slim zip-up case\nThe best, slimmest zip-up case you should buy is made by Tomtoc. Compared to the Belkin hard zip-up case that I got my hands on before the Switch 2‚Äôs launch, the Tomtoc FancyCase slim case feels more durable; anecdotally, it holds up much better to being squeezed by hand. It even has more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2 sticks, so it‚Äôll never press them in on accident. Like most zip-up cases, it features a screen cover that doubles as cartridge storage. This one can hold 12 cartridges.\nI‚Äôm confident that it‚Äôll absorb more potential damage over time than other cases I‚Äôve tried. Plus, it just looks cooler, with low-profile designs for gamers who don‚Äôt want to draw attention to their console. That said, its ‚ÄúFroz Edition‚Äù has ice cream-inspired looks that are a lot more expressive.\ntomtoc slim carrying case for the Switch 2\nThis hard case has a soft touch and a slim fit, and includes a flap that can hold up to 12 cartridges as it protects the console‚Äôs screen.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $47.99 $33 at Amazon\n\nBelkin fabric zip-up case\nBelkin‚Äôs $29.99 zip-up case is another competent, good-looking option that‚Äôs slim and lightweight. It‚Äôs worth considering over the Tomtoc for one reason only: its built-in pocket, which is great if you need to stow a charging cable or any other small doo-dads.¬†Not to mention, this pocket contains another pocket for an AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, so you can track this case‚Äôs location should you lose track of it.\nBelkin makes a thicker, pricier version of this case that has a 20,000mAh 20W battery inside. It‚Äôs nearly identical until you open it. A cutout fits this (and only this) Belkin battery perfectly, and it lets you charge your Switch 2 at top speeds while it‚Äôs protected.\nBelkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 at Amazon\n $29.99 at Belkin\n\nBest Switch 2 cameras\nThe best webcam that you can get for your Switch 2 should be the cheapest one you can find that‚Äôs guaranteed to work with it. So far, Logitech has confirmed that almost all of its webcams support the Switch 2, and Elgato has updated its Facecam MK.2 to support it, as well. Elgato‚Äôs model is pricier than we recommend most people spend, but it‚Äôs a solid option if you also have a PC to use it with. It‚Äôs worth knowing that the Switch 2 displays low-fidelity video feeds during gameplay, so unless you plan to use the webcam with your PC as well, it‚Äôs not worth spending a lot for a model that promises great video quality.¬†\nLogitech Brio 100 webcam\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $39.99 $24.99 at Amazon\n $39.99 $24.99 at Staples\n $39.99 $24.99 at Logitech\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Camera\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $54 at Walmart\n $54.99 at Best Buy\n $54.99 at Target\n\nElgato Facecam MK.2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $139.99 at Best Buy\n $139.99 $123.39 at Amazon\n $139.99 $129.99 at B&H Photo\n\nBest Switch 2 portable batteries\nThe Switch 2 is more powerful than the original Switch. However, it doesn‚Äôt require all that much more power to charge, even while you‚Äôre playing games. While new phones and tablets are breaking new ground with fast charging speeds, getting a power bank that can deliver at least 20W is totally sufficient to get the fastest-possible charging speeds with the Switch 2 in handheld mode.¬†\nBy using a display-equipped USB-C cable with a wattage reading, I was able to see that the Switch 2 usually pulls a maximum of about 15-17W of power (sometimes less) from a USB-C battery during gameplay. When the system was asleep, the rate went down to between 8-13W, fluctuating at different points during the charging process. From a totally dead state, the console took almost 90 minutes to reach 69 percent with a 20W battery plugged into it. You‚Äôll likely drain your USB-C battery more quickly if you‚Äôre playing as you charge.\nThankfully, your options for compatible batteries are plentiful. You‚Äôll likely be paying for more power than you‚Äôll need with the Switch 2, but more power (and especially more ports) are never a bad thing to have too much of.\nAnker Zolo Power Bank (10K, 30W)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $25.99 $16.09 at Amazon (with Prime)\n $25.99 at Anker\n\nUgreen Nexode power bank (20K, 45W)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $45.99 $34.99 at Amazon\n\nBaseus Picogo power bank (10K, 45W)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $39.99 $25.99 at Amazon\n\nBest microSD Express cards for Switch 2\nThe Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards of up to 2TB, even though models with that amount of storage aren‚Äôt yet available for purchase.

Earlier this year, Meta paid $25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over the suspensions of his accounts.\nOther people have attempted to file lawsuits alleging AI chatbot defamation.

The Wayback Machine will no longer be able to crawl post detail pages, comments, or profiles; instead, it will only be able to index the Reddit.com homepage, which effectively means Internet Archive will only be able to archive insights into which news headlines and posts were most popular on a given day.\n‚ÄúInternet Archive provides a service to the open web, but we‚Äôve been made aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine,‚Äù spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt tells The Verge.¬†\nThe Internet Archive‚Äôs mission is to keep a digital archive of websites on the internet and ‚Äúother cultural artifacts,‚Äù and the Wayback Machine is a tool you can use to look at pages as they appeared on certain dates, but Reddit believes not all of its content should be archived that way.‚ÄúUntil they‚Äôre able to defend their site and comply with platform policies (e.g., respecting user privacy, re: deleting removed content) we‚Äôre limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors,‚Äù Rathschmidt says.¬†\nThe limits will start ‚Äúramping up‚Äù today, and Reddit says it reached out to the Internet Archive ‚Äúin advance‚Äù to ‚Äúinform them of the limits before they go into effect,‚Äù according to Rathschmidt. He says Reddit has also ‚Äúraised concerns‚Äù about the ability of people to scrape content from the Internet Archive in the past.\nReddit has a recent history of cutting off access to scraper tools as AI companies have begun to use (and abuse) them en masse, but it‚Äôs willing to provide that data if companies pay. Last year, Reddit struck a deal with Google for both Google Search and AI training data early last year, and a few months later, it started blocking major search engines from crawling its data unless they pay. It also said its infamous API changes from 2023, which forced some third-party apps to shut down, leading to protests, were because those APIs were abused to train AI models.¬†\nReddit also struck an AI deal with¬†OpenAI, but it¬†sued Anthropic¬†in June, claiming Anthropic was still scraping from Reddit even after Anthropic¬†said it¬†wasn‚Äôt scraping anymore.\n‚ÄúWe have a longstanding relationship with Reddit and continue to have ongoing discussions about this matter,‚Äù Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, says in a statement to The Verge.\nUpdate, August 11th: Added statement from the Wayback Machine.",
