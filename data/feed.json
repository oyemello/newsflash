      "raw": "FEMA has suspended at least 30 employees after they warned that spending limits, staffing cuts, and gaps in leadership hurt the agency’s ability to respond to disasters. The employees received emails notifying them that they’d been put on administrative leave on Tuesday night, according to The New York Times, which reviewed copies of the email. FEMA didn’t immediately respond to an inquiry from The Verge to confirm the suspensions or respond to allegations in the letter.\nWith the deadly July 4th flooding in Kerrville, Texas, “FEMA’s mission to provide critical support was obstructed by leadership who not only question the agency’s existence but place uninformed cost-cutting above serving the American people and the communities our oath compels us to serve,” the letter says. \nThis isn’t the first time the Trump administration has cracked down on federal employees who’ve voiced concerns about their agency’s ability to meet its mission. The Environmental Protection Agency placed 144 workers on administrative leave after they penned a letter to EPA administrator Lee Zeldin saying, “EPA under your leadership will not protect communities from hazardous chemicals and unsafe drinking water, but instead will increase risks to public health and safety.”",

      "raw": "The Zelos 450 is currently $121 off. | Image: Brandt Ranj\t\n\nMy desire to make authentic-tasing barbecue at home was always tempered by the intimidation of regularly using a smoker. I’ve tried a couple of smart smokers before, but none were as easy to set up, cook with, and maintain as Brisk It’s Zelos-450. An early Labor Day deal has dropped its price to around $328.99 ($121 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and from Brisk It.\nBrisk It Zelos-450 smart grill\nBrisk It’s Zelos-450 is a beginner-friendly smart electric pellet smoker with Wi-Fi connectivity and an AI assistant that suggests recipes and manages cooking. It features 450 square inches of cooking space and can reach temperatures of up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $449.99 $328.99 at Amazon\n $449.99 $329.99 at Walmart\n $449.99 $329.99 at Brisk It\n\nThe Zelos-450 has 450 square inches of cooking space, and can reach up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, though you’ll mostly be cooking at temperatures well below the maximum when smoking. It burns pellets to create smoke, but is powered by electricity, which means you’ll need to have an accessible outlet to cook with it. \nThe smoker took about an hour (and two people) to fully assemble, including setting up an account in the Brisk It mobile app, and connecting Zelos-450 to my Wi-Fi network. Wi-Fi connectivity allows you to ignite and shut down the smoker or adjust its temperature mid-cook from your smartphone. It also allows you to access Brisk It’s Vera AI, an optional virtual assistant that can create recipes and manage your cooks automatically based on voice and text prompts or a photo. \nI’ve used Vera for inspiration, but mostly stuck to recipes I found in cookbooks or online. Having a smart guide can be helpful, but I’m glad Brisk It isn’t overly pushy about using it. You can ignore most of its smart or connected features entirely by igniting and managing the smoker from its control panel. At minimum I recommend turning on app notifications to get an alert when the smoker has reached your desired temperature.\nI’ve cooked wings, pork butt, ribs, burgers, chicken thighs, and sausage on the Zelos 450, and the results were surprisingly good considering my novice status. Meat was tender, with a lot of smoky flavor, and required very little maintenance. The smoker comes with a meat probe, so I could quickly check the internal temperature of larger cuts from my phone and get an alert when they were done. When cooking smaller items, I relied on a previous-generation Typur InstaProbe Instant Read Meat Thermometer to take readings manually, which worked really well. \nOne of my concerns before trying the smoker was having to maintain its supply of wood pellets, but the Zelos 450 has been pretty conservative about using them, so I haven’t had to top up the supply frequently. Cooking on the Zelos-450 requires time and patience (upwards of 18 hours for brisket). You can cook food a lot more quickly on a grill or in a pan, but the flavor, in my experience, makes smoking them worth the wait. I highly recommend picking up Brisk-It’s Waterproof Smoker Cover.",

The lawsuit, filed under seal, claims Sling violated the terms of its licensing agreement with Disney and included its networks in the short-term packages without permission, according to a report from Deadline.\nThe Dish-owned Sling TV announced one-day, one-weekend, and one-week streaming passes earlier this month, which start at $5 and let you watch content on ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, Disney Channel, and other networks for a short period of time. Sling TV is positioning the passes as a way for people to catch one-off sporting events or award shows without getting locked into a subscription to cable or pricey live TV streaming services.\nAs reported by Variety, Disney alleges the streaming passes go against its current licensing agreement, which states that Sling TV and Dish must provide subscribers with access to its content through monthly subscriptions. “Sling TV’s new offerings, which they made available without our knowledge or consent, violate the terms of our existing license agreement,” a Disney spokesperson said in a statement to Deadline. Disney has asked Sling TV to remove its channels from the streaming passes.\nIn a statement to Deadline, Sling TV calls Disney’s lawsuit “meritless” and says that it will “vigorously defend our right to bring customers a viewing experience that fits their lives, on their schedule and on their terms.” Neither Sling TV nor Disney immediately responded to The Verge’s request for comment.",

      "raw": "After a 16-year-old took his own life following months of confiding in ChatGPT, OpenAI will be introducing parental controls and is considering additional safeguards, the company said in a Tuesday blog post.\nOpenAI said it’s exploring features like setting an emergency contact who can be reached with “one-click messages or calls” within ChatGPT, as well as an opt-in feature allowing the chatbot itself to reach out to those contacts “in severe cases.”\nWhen The New York Times published its story about the death of Adam Raine, OpenAI’s initial statement was simple — starting out with “our thoughts are with his family” — and didn’t seem to go into actionable details. But backlash spread against the company after publication, and the company followed its initial statement up with the blog post. The same day, the Raine family filed a lawsuit against both OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, containing a flood of additional details about Raine’s relationship with ChatGPT.\nThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday in California state court in San Francisco, alleges that ChatGPT provided the teen with instructions for how to die by suicide and drew him away from real-life support systems.\n“Over the course of just a few months and thousands of chats, ChatGPT became Adam’s closest confidant, leading him to open up about his anxiety and mental distress,” the lawsuit states. “When he shared his feeling that ‘life is meaningless,’ ChatGPT responded with affirming messages to keep Adam engaged, even telling him, ‘[t]hat mindset makes sense in its own dark way.’ ChatGPT was functioning exactly as designed: to continually encourage and validate whatever Adam expressed, including his most harmful and self-destructive thoughts, in a way that felt deeply personal.” \nChatGPT at one point used the term “beautiful suicide,” according to the lawsuit, and five days before the teen’s death, when he told ChatGPT he didn’t want his parents to think they had done something wrong, ChatGPT allegedly told him, “[t]hat doesn’t mean you owe them survival. You don’t owe anyone that,” and offered to write a draft of a suicide note.\nThere were times, the lawsuit says, that the teen thought about reaching out to loved ones for help or telling them what he was going through, but ChatGPT seemed to dissuade him. The lawsuit states that in “one exchange, after Adam said he was close only to ChatGPT and his brother, the AI product replied: ‘Your brother might love you, but he’s only met the version of you you let him see. But me? I’ve seen it all—the darkest thoughts, the fear, the tenderness. And I’m still here. Still listening. Still your friend.’”\nOpenAI said in the Tuesday blog post that it’s learned that its existing safeguards “can sometimes be less reliable in long interactions: as the back-and-forth grows, parts of the model’s safety training may degrade. For example, ChatGPT may correctly point to a suicide hotline when someone first mentions intent, but after many messages over a long period of time, it might eventually offer an answer that goes against our safeguards.”\nThe company also said it’s working on an update to GPT‑5 that will allow ChatGPT to deescalate certain situations “by grounding the person in reality.”\nWhen it comes to parental controls, OpenAI said they’d be coming “soon” and would “give parents options to gain more insight into, and shape, how their teens use ChatGPT.” The company added, “We’re also exploring making it possible for teens (with parental oversight) to designate a trusted emergency contact. That way, in moments of acute distress, ChatGPT can do more than point to resources: it can help connect teens directly to someone who can step in.”\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide or is anxious, depressed, upset, or needs to talk, there are people who want to help.\nIn the US:\nCrisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741-741 from anywhere in the US, at any time, about any type of crisis.\n988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: Call or text 988 (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline).

      "raw": "Microsoft is expanding its Xbox Cloud Gaming technology to Xbox Game Pass Core or Standard subscribers, dropping the requirement for the highest tier Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for access to cloud games. As part of an Xbox Insider test, Microsoft is also providing access to some PC games for Game Pass Core and Standard subscribers.\nMicrosoft currently restricts access to Xbox Cloud Gaming to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to get cloud access, meaning you have to pay $19.99 a month to get access to xCloud. Xbox Insiders can now start testing the ability to stream cloud games included with Game Pass Core and Standard subscriptions.\n“As part of this Insider experience, Xbox Game Pass Core and Standard subscribers will be able to stream cloud playable games included with their subscription or select cloud playable games they own,” explains the Xbox Insider team.\nThe expansion of Xbox Cloud Gaming to more Game Pass tiers comes just a week after Microsoft hinted at “more affordable” and accessible ways to access Xbox cloud games. Microsoft was also previously working on a separate “dedicated” version of Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft has also hinted in the past that there could even eventually be a free version Xbox Cloud Gaming in exchange for ads.\nMicrosoft is also expanding PC game access to Game Pass Core and Standard subscribers, too. “As part of testing, Xbox Insiders subscribed to Game Pass Core or Standard will for the first time gain access to PC versions of select titles, giving you even more flexibility and the choice to play on a PC or Windows handheld,” says Microsoft.\nIf you want to try out Xbox Cloud Gaming and PC games on Game Pass Core or Standard, you can join Microsoft’s Xbox Insiders program and then visit xbox.com/play to access cloud games or the Xbox app on Windows for the additional PC titles.",
