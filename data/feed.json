Smith said that Microsoft disagreed with some of the report’s findings, but that others warranted investigation.\n“We are working every day to get to the bottom of what’s going on, and we will,” Smith said.\nAn organizer for No Azure for Apartheid, Abdo Mohamed, earlier today told The Verge that Microsoft employees Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle were part of the protest. They were joined by former Microsoft employees Vaniya Agrawal, Hossam Nasr, and Joe Lopez.\nSmith said that seven people in total were involved with today’s protests, with two of them being Microsoft employees. The people were removed by Redmond police, he said.\n“When seven folks do as they did today, storm a building, occupy an office, lock other people out of the office, plant listening devices — even in crude form, in the form of telephones, cellphones hidden under couches and behind books — that’s not ok,” Smith said. “When they’re asked to leave and they refused, that’s not ok.”",

The smartwatch is similar to the Venu 3 but features a larger 1.4-inch OLED display and up to 14 days of battery life. Otherwise, the two models are identical; both offer a suite of advanced features, including sleep coaching and nap detection, along with the same heart rate sensors that support EKG readings for detecting atrial fibrillation.\nGarmin inReach Mini 2\nGarmin’s palm-sized inReach Mini 2 satellite communicator provides off-the-grid two-way messaging, built-in navigation capabilities, and powerful mapping features, such as the ability to set waypoints when paired with Garmin’s Explore app. A subscription plan is required to access the Iridium network, with prices starting at $7.99 a month.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 $349.99 at Amazon\n $399.99 $349.99 at REI\n $399.99 $349.99 at Garmin\n\nGarmin’s inReach Messenger is down to $249 ($50 off) at REI, Amazon, and Best Buy. The rugged communication device also supports two-way text messaging and the ability to trigger emergency SOS alerts, but it lacks support for advanced mapping functionality. That being said, it offers better battery life than the inReach Mini 2, along with a patch antenna design, which promises better connectivity. Just note that an active satellite subscription is required, with plans starting at $7.99 a month.\nEcoFlow River 3 Plus Portable Power Station\nThe River 3 Plus is a relatively compact but mighty portable power station with an output of up to 600W. It weighs 10 pounds, features app support, and can double as an uninterruptible power supply in emergencies.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 $175.99 at REI\n $299 at Amazon\n $299 at EcoFlow\n\n\nInsta360 X5\nThe Insta360 X5 is a powerful 360-degree camera that offers a larger sensor and new image processing.

Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.95 $139.95 at REI\n $179.95 $139.95 at Amazon\n $179.95 $139.95 at Best Buy\n\nThe Shokz OpenFit 2 offer a nice upgrade over the original model, and they’re currently down to an all-time low of $139.99 ($40 off) at REI, Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. Each bud features two speakers: one dedicated to bass and another to mids and highs. The ear hooks have also been redesigned to be thinner, so the OpenFit 2 fit better while wearing glasses. Meanwhile, physical buttons were added to each bud, making it easy to control your audio. Read our hands-on impressions.\nThe original Shokz OpenFit are also currently on sale for $119.93 (about $40 off) at REI, which is a new low price. The wireless earbuds feature an open-ear design, so instead of going into your ear canal, they sit just outside it. That means you can still hear your surroundings while listening to music and podcasts, making them a safe option for exercising outdoors. They’re also lightweight, feature an IP54 rating for water resistance, and offer up to seven hours of battery life.\nIf you own an older iPhone with a Lightning port, you can grab InfinityLab’s InstantGo 5000 Power Bank for just $29.93 (about $20 off) at REI. The portable battery features a 5,000mAh capacity and a built-in Lightning cable, making it a solid all-in-one option for days when you won’t be near an outlet. It also supports passthrough charging, allowing you to charge your phone and the power bank at the same time.\nLifeStraw Peak Series Straw\nLifeStraw’s redesigned Peak Series Straw features a durable, leakproof design that’s great for backcountry treks. It can remove unwanted viruses, bacteria, and microplastics as you drink — just like the base model — but benefits from an increased flow rate and more premium materials.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $24.95 $18.69 at REI\n $24.95 $18.71 at Amazon\n $24.95 $18.71 at LifeStraw\n\nThe JetBoil Stash Cooking System is a compact, lightweight cooking system that’s currently down to $123.69 (about $41 off) at REI — one of the lowest prices we’ve seen all summer. It features a standalone stove with a titanium burner and a 0.8-liter cooking pot, allowing you to boil water or heat food at your campsite. The pot comes with a lid and a pour handle, and everything can be stowed inside the pot when you’re finished, making packing easy.\nMSR’s TrailShot Pocket-Sized Water Filter is currently going for around $48 (about $16 off) at REI and Amazon, which is the lowest price we’ve seen in months. The 5.2-ounce water filter is small enough to fit in your pocket and easy enough to use one-handed, letting you quickly remove 99 percent of bacteria, protozoa, and particulates. You can use the water filter to drink directly from a water source or fill a 1-liter bottle in just 60 seconds. And it’s easy to clean, too — just give it a few shakes to restore the flow rate.\nREI’s Co-op Half Dome 2 Tent, a classic that offers enough room to comfortably fit two people, is currently on sale for $224.19 (about $85 off) at REI. It’s easy to set up and pack down, and it features two D-shaped doors, providing ample room to get in and out.

It also offers a rain cover to keep you dry when the weather suddenly turns.\nKelty Low Loveseat\nThe Kelty Low Loveseat is a sturdy, low-profile camp chair built for two.

      "raw": "Anthropic has settled a class action lawsuit with a group of US authors who accused the AI startup of copyright infringement. In a legal filing on Tuesday, Anthropic says it has negotiated a “proposed class settlement,” allowing it to skip a trial that would have determined how much the company owes for allegedly training its AI models on pirated work.\nThe terms of the settlement still aren’t clear, but it stems from a copyright lawsuit filed by writers Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson last year, which claimed Anthropic trained its Claude AI models on an open-source dataset filled with pirated materials.\nAnthropic scored a major victory in June when Judge William Alsup ruled that training AI models on legally purchased books counts as fair use, but he left the door open for further litigation. In July, Judge Alsup approved a class action lawsuit from US authors that accused Anthropic of violating copyright laws “by doing Napster-style downloading of millions of works.” Anthropic was set to go to trial over the piracy claims in December, where it could’ve faced billions or more than $1 trillion in penalties, according to Wired.\nThe settlement is expected to be finalized on September 3rd. “This historic settlement will benefit all class members,” Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors, said in a statement to The Verge. “We look forward to announcing details of the settlement in the coming weeks.” Anthropic declined to comment.",

      "raw": "Nuclear fusion is on the upswing, as more companies pile into the space to achieve what’s often described as the Holy Grail of clean energy, according to an updated map from the Clean Air Task Force (CATF). \nNuclear fusion aims to replicate the way the Sun produces light and heat, generating a tremendous amount of energy when atomic nuclei fuse together. Figuring out how to do that in a controlled way on Earth would unlock an energy source that avoids the greenhouse gas pollution from fossil fuels and radioactive waste from existing nuclear fission reactors that split atoms apart. \nThat’s all easier said than done, of course. Researchers have been chasing the dream for nearly a century. The biggest breakthrough yet took place in 2022, when researchers were able to reach a net energy gain from a fusion reaction for the very first time. That took place at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, and other initiatives are still trying to replicate that success with the goal of one day being able to generate electricity from a fusion power plant.\n\nThe number of companies developing fusion technologies has grown\n\n\nThose efforts are ramping up, according to CATF citing publicly available resources and its own discussions with individual companies and investors. The number of companies developing fusion technologies has grown, particularly in North America and Europe. You can take a look at CATF’s fusion map to see where this is all happening, including government-supported programs. \nIn Washington state, Microsoft inked a deal with Helion Energy to purchase electricity from a fusion generator they think will be ready by 2028. In a similar move, Google announced an agreement in June to purchase 200 megawatts of “future carbon-free power” from Massachusetts-based Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a company in which Google is also an investor. \nOther experts The Verge has spoken to over the years say it could take decades longer before fusion energy becomes commercially viable, assuming developers ever overcome the engineering challenges. \n“There is still a lot of scientific and engineering work that these companies need to complete before they produce net energy, but these companies have created a clear roadmap to commercialization for investors and the market is responding,” says Patrick White, group lead for fusion energy and safety regulation, in an email to The Verge.\nFifty-three fusion companies have received a total of $8.9 billion in private funding and $795 million in public funding, according to a 2025 survey by the Fusion Industry Association. That’s compared to just 23 respondents who reported a combined total $1.9 billion in private and public funding in 2021.",

Following its initial debut back in June, the Sony-produced animated musical quickly became a cultural phenomenon whose songs have been sitting pretty at the top of the Billboard charts basically ever since. \nThe movie’s undeniable success came as something of a surprise, given how Sony opted to basically sell the project to Netflix rather than trying to distribute it with a traditional theatrical release.\nNetflix was able to capitalize on the KPop Demon Hunters’ hype with a limited theatrical run that turned it into the number one movie at the US box office this past weekend. And because the film had already screened in select theaters right after it hit Netflix, it’s pretty much a given that we’ll see Huntri/x at the next Oscars.",

      "raw": "Today, Framework announced the second-gen Framework Laptop 16 with two industry firsts: the first Nvidia laptop graphics card upgrade you can perform at home in just a couple minutes, and the first complete 240W laptop charging solution over a USB-C cable.\nBut the company’s also revealing some intriguing upgrades that didn’t quite make the cut — including an extra-large haptic touchpad a la Apple’s MacBooks (with no physical click), and the company’s first external graphics module (eGPU).\nNot everything in the video below is actually coming to market, and some of it won’t be aimed at everyday consumers. Framework CEO Nirav Patel says he’s working to bring the fan-favorite ThinkPad Trackpoint nub to its keyboards, but keeps failing because the team can’t find a short enough nub that it doesn’t poke into the Laptop 16’s screen. \n\nBut he says a wide haptic touchpad is genuinely in development, one that won’t need the Framework Laptop 16’s modular spacers to give you a full-width palmrest. And if your main concern is just removing those spacers (I occasionally found the uneven surface annoying in my review), Framework says it’ll release 3D files so you can print your own full-width palmrest for the existing touchpad, in any color you like.\nHere’s a look at that 3D-printed one:\nFramework also says an eGPU is actually in development that uses the Framework Laptop 16’s GPU modules, but not as a consumer product. Patel says that would make it too expensive to fulfill the team’s main goal: “We want to make sure there is a pathway to reuse graphics modules coming out of the Framework Laptop 16, so they’re not sitting in a drawer or worse going out into a landfill somewhere.”\nSo it won’t look like the prototype you see below, but rather something targeted at makers, he says — perhaps we’ll have to 3D print the case for that one ourselves as well.\nPatel also says Framework’s One Key Modules for building your own custom keyboards are still in development — “we’re working hard to bring up the manufacturing yield so we can make it available at a reasonable price” — and expects he’ll be able to offer 64GB RAM modules before long. A transparent bezel for the Framework Laptop 16 didn’t make the cut because it turned out too brittle, though the team’s still looking for polycarbonate or resin blends that’d work better.\nAs for why it’s shipping a new Nvidia RTX 5070 graphics module with just 8GB of RAM, Patel says in a Q&A that’s how much is available with a mobile 5070, and that’s how much could fit into the current design, which only has space for four memory packages on the front.\nWhile they could have gone with a more powerful GPU, “we’d have to grow the thickness of the graphics module by putting them on both sides of the board,” which would increase the thickness of the graphics bay, which would increase the thickness of the laptop, among other adjustments. \n“For this generation, 5070 8GB is it,” says Patel.",
