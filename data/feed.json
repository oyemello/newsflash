      "raw": "Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the Democratic Federal Trade Commissioner fired by President Donald Trump without cause, can at least temporarily return to work while her legal case plays out. \nThis happened once before when Slaughter briefly returned to her office months after Trump claimed to fire her, when US District Court Judge Loren AliKhan found her dismissal unlawful. Trump broke with decades of Supreme Court precedent known as Humphrey’s Executor, preventing presidents from firing independent commissioners without cause. But her return was short-lived — a few days later the appeals court temporarily paused the order reinstating Slaughter.\nThis latest order, approved 2-1 by a panel of appeals court judges, dissolves that stay and lets Slaughter get back to work until they decide on the merits of the case. While the majority judges don’t actually rule on the case, they write that the government is not likely to win, since “any ruling in its favor from this court would have to defy binding, on-point, and repeatedly preserved Supreme Court precedent.”",

      "raw": "On August 5th, 2024, Judge Amit Mehta ruled in the case of United States of America v. Google, saying, “…the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.” \nNearly a year later, the judge has followed that up with a ruling on remedies for Google’s search monopoly. While lawyers for the Department of Justice had argued that Google should be broken up and forced to split off products like Chrome, Search, and Android, Judge Mehta has ruled against the DOJ’s proposed remedies, banning exclusive deals but leaving others, like its massive search default deal with Apple, and allowing Google to keep Chrome.\nOf course, even that isn’t enough to end the biggest tech antitrust trial since the US took on Microsoft in the 1990s — possibly aside from the government’s antitrust case targeting Google’s ad business. Lawyers for Google and the Department of Justice will continue arguing over the ruling in appeals, as well as what to do about the company and its products.\nRead on below for all of the updates and notes from the case.\nHere’s what Google and the DOJ had to say about the search remedies ruling.\n\t\t\t\nGoogle gets to keep Chrome, judge rules in search antitrust case\n\t\t\t\nInside the courthouse reshaping the future of the internet\n\t\t\t\nThe Google remedies trial is over.\n\t\t\t\nGoogle wants a 60-day stay on any remedies.\n\t\t\t\nGoogle attorney: “This is a trainwreck of a technical committee.”\n\t\t\t\nThe “delicate balance” of advertisers.\n\t\t\t\nBack to Google, into overtime.\n\t\t\t\nLightning round.\n\t\t\t\n“Hey, you wanna try Bing for ten bucks?”\n\t\t\t\nWe’re nearing the end.\n\t\t\t\n“Google thinks it’s the only one that can invent things.”\n\t\t\t\n“The value of Chrome to Google is substantially more than the value of Chrome to anyone else.”\n\t\t\t\nGoogle’s attorney cites a “laundry list” of reasons selling Chrome (and maybe Android) is bad.\n\t\t\t\nThe future of Chromium depends on acquihiring, apparently.\n\t\t\t\nThe future of Chromium.\n\t\t\t\n“Let’s talk about Chrome.”\n\t\t\t\nA quick recap.\n\t\t\t\nJudge: “I’m not sure Microsoft would even step forward and put very much in the pot.”\n\t\t\t\n“Microsoft’s not coming in with a non-exclusive deal,” says Google lawyer.\n\t\t\t\n“We just like, threw it out there, to see what would happen!”\n\t\t\t\n“Maybe people don’t want ten blue links anymore.”\n\t\t\t\nCan Google possibly lose in a ban on placement deals?\n\t\t\t\nShould Firefox die to punish Google?\n\t\t\t\n“Those payments have frozen the ecosystem.”\n\t\t\t\nNext up: distribution.\n\t\t\t\nAnother break.\n\t\t\t\nPrivacy is becoming a sticking point.\n\t\t\t\n“I think the privacy stuff is a complete failure here.”\n\t\t\t\nWe’re back to Google.\n\t\t\t\nCould Google only share the long tail?\n\t\t\t\n“Nobody’s really testified about user-side data.”\n\t\t\t\nMehta still seems skeptical of the link between AI and search.\n\t\t\t\nShould AI companies get syndicated data from Google?\n\t\t\t\nBack now, talking about data and scale.\n\t\t\t\nBreak time.\n\t\t\t\n“Our remedies are tied to barriers to entry.”\n\t\t\t\nGoogle is still the best search engine for Apple, says attorney.\n\t\t\t\nAI is back up for debate.\n\t\t\t\nJudge Mehta: is there a middle ground on data-sharing?\n\t\t\t\n“By definition, network effects crowd out competition,” says Mehta.\n\t\t\t\nGoogle lawyer: “Was anybody clamoring to preload Bing on these devices?”\n\t\t\t\nGoogle’s lawyer is up.\n\t\t\t\nLots of AI questions to the DOJ.\n\t\t\t\n“Google’s self-reinforcing monopoly machine.”\n\t\t\t\nClosing arguments in the Google search antitrust trial.\n\t\t\t\nGoogle rejected giving publishers more choice to opt out of AI Search\n\t\t\t\nEddy Cue is fighting to save Apple’s $20 billion paycheck from Google\n\t\t\t\nApple’s Eddy Cue: ‘You may not need an iPhone 10 years from now’\n\t\t\t\nGoogle searches are falling in Safari for the first time ever — probably because of AI\n\t\t\t\nApple is looking at adding Perplexity and other AI search engines to Safari\n\t\t\t\nDOJ’s proposed Google changes would ‘deeply undermine user trust,’ search chief says\n\t\t\t\nPublisher opt-outs of AI training cut Google’s DeepMind training data in half.\n\t\t\t\nFirefox could be doomed without Google search deal, says executive\n\t\t\t\nSundar Pichai says the DOJ’s antitrust plan could kill Google Search\n\t\t\t\nGoogle confirms it’s close to getting Gemini support on iPhones\n\t\t\t\nTough day in court for Google Plus and Google Buzz.\n\t\t\t\nSundar Pichai says the remedies against Google would be a crushing blow.\n\t\t\t\nIt’s Sundar time in US v.

      "raw": "Apple’s latest 13-inch MacBook Air with an M4 chip is on sale starting at $799 ($200 off).\t\n\nApple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points. It discontinued the M1 MacBook Air to make room for newer models, but some retailers are still selling the 2020 laptop starting at $599 ($50 off) at Walmart — a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro.\nPurchasing a new MacBook can be a pricey endeavor, but finding a deal is surprisingly easy. Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models.\n\nThe best MacBook Air deals\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\nThe best Mac Mini deals\n\nAlthough Macs may not get perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $800. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store provides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.\nBut if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.\nThe best MacBook Air deals\nM1 MacBook Air\nThe M1 MacBook Air was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and brick-and-mortar stores. It’s still a great choice if you want a MacBook for non-intensive productivity work, especially given that it features a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been removed in our guide to the best laptops.\nThe base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has committed to keeping it around for the foreseeable future and is currently discounting it to $599 ($50 off), which is its lowest price to date.\n2020 MacBook Air with M1 (256GB)\nThe 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold).\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $649 $599 at Walmart\n\nM2 MacBook Air\nThe M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor wasn’t as revolutionary as the M1 generation, it’s a better performer for any kind of user than the M1, including creators with demanding workloads.\nIt does have some slight downsides, though, including slower storage in the base 256GB configuration and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop than this one since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the best laptops.\nThe M2-powered MacBook Air from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning; however, you can still get the 13-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors at Best Buy starting at $699 ($100 off). The 15-inch MacBook Air M2 is also still available in short supply at some retailers for its original MSRP, though, at this point, you’d be better off going with a discounted M4 model.\n13-inch MacBook Air with M2 (2022)\nThe 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $699 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n\nM3 MacBook Air\nThe M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for the M3 MacBook Air to exist. Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in 2023 in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port. Apple discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM last year and now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration.\nThe entry-level 13-inch M3 MacBook Air configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is tough to find in stock. However, you can get the 24GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU for $1,099 ($200 off) in select colors at Best Buy. Given the relatively small price difference between these two models, it’s great that you’re getting double the amount of internal storage and additional memory. \nAs for the M3-powered 15-inch MacBook Air, you can buy it in select colors at Best Buy and B&H Photo with 256GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and a 10-core GPU for $899 ($200 off). Meanwhile, the upgraded model with 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and a 10-core GPU is currently down to $1,099 ($200 off) at Best Buy. If you need even more memory, the model with 512GB of storage, 24GB of RAM, and a 10-core GPU is available for $1,199 ($450 off) at Best Buy and B&H Photo.\n13-inch MacBook Air with M3 (2024)\nThe MacBook Air M3 is a jack-of-all-trades, with a balanced combination of performance and power efficiency. It also now supports dual displays with the lid closed, and the storage speed is noticeably faster. You don’t need to think about if this laptop will meet your needs — it just will.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1299 $1099 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\n\nApple MacBook Air M3 (15-inch)\nThe 15-inch MacBook Air is also equipped with Apple’s M3 chip. It features a larger display and better speaker array than the 13-inch MacBook Air M3. As of October 2024, it starts with 16GB of RAM instead of the original 8GB when it launched.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1099 $899 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n $1099 $899 at B&H Photo (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n $1299 $1099 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nM4 MacBook Air\nIn March, along with an updated Mac Studio, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.\nBoth the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some sizable discounts. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon in select colors starting $799 ($200 off). If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $1,049 ($150 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\n13-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\nPowered by the M4 chip, Apple’s latest 13-inch MacBook Air is faster than its predecessor and offers double the base RAM. It can also now connect to two external displays with the lid open and features an improved Center Stage webcam.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 $799 at Amazon\n $999 $869 at B&H Photo\n\n\n15-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\nApple’s 15-inch MacBook Air with the M4 chip is nearly identical to its 13-inch sibling. However, it includes a six-speaker sound system, not four, and your choice of a free 35W Dual USB‑C Port Compact Power Adapter or 70W USB‑C Power Adapter.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199 $1049 at Amazon\n $1199 $1049 at B&H Photo\n\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\nDuring its “Scary Fast” event in 2023, Apple announced MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with M4-based machines in October 2024, but the last-gen M3 models can often be the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts.\nM3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro\nThe entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).\nThe M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup.\nWe’re having trouble finding the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock. However, Best Buy is selling the 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a 10-core GPU for $1,199 ($400 off). If you need a higher-powered laptop with a larger display, you can get the 16-inch, M3 Pro-powered MacBook Pro with 36GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and an 18-core GPU for $2,299 ($500 off) at Best Buy.\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (2023)\nApple’s previous-gen 14-inch laptop powered by the M3 processor uses a similar design to the pricier 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s Pro- / Max-series chips but is offered at a lower price with similar ports and less RAM.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1199 at Best Buy (8GB RAM, 1TB SSD)\n\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\nApple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November 2024. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option.\nMany variations of the M4 MacBook Pro with different screen and processor configurations are on sale right now. For example, you can currently pick up the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD at Amazon for $1,412.54 (about $185 off). Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,699 ($300 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.\nThe base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,205.28 (about $294 off) at Amazon.\nApple MacBook Pro 14 (2024, M4)\nThe entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — and a 512GB SSD for the same starting price of $1,599. It also gets a third USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port and comes in a new space black option.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1412.54 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1599 $1499 at B&H Photo (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\n\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro\nThe 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 12-core / 16-core M4 Pro chip starts with 24GB of RAM — a 6GB increase over the prior generation. It also has a 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, an optional nano-texture display, and a 12-megapixel webcam.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $1699 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $1699 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $1799 at B&H Photo (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\n\nApple MacBook Pro 16 (2024, M4 Pro)\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM and offers more computing cores (14 for the CPU and 20 for the GPU) compared to the 14-inch model. It also picks up Thunderbolt 5 ports and a new 12-megapixel Center Stage camera.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $2205.28 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $2299 at B&H Photo (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nThe best Mac Mini deals\nThe newest Mac Minis in town are the M4-based models, which arrived late last year. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.\nM4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini\nDeals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.\nIn addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.\nRight now, you can get the base Mac Mini at B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $549 ($51 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for around $743 ($66 off) at B&H Photo and Amazon.\nMeanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale for around $1,255 ($144 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\nApple Mac Mini (M4)\nThe latest Mac Mini features Apple’s upgraded M4 chips and a smaller build than the prior model. Each configuration now starts with 16GB of RAM and includes five total Thunderbolt ports, gigabit ethernet, HDMI, and a 3.5mm jack. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 $549 at B&H Photo (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n $599 $557 at Amazon (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n $799 $743 at Amazon (M4 Pro, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nUpdate, September 2nd: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability.",

Google antitrust case on Tuesday. Executives from both Apple and Firefox-made Mozilla have defended their search deals with Google, with Mozilla’s CFO testifying that Firefox might be doomed without the deal in place.\n“Google will not be barred from making payments or offering other consideration to distribution partners for preloading or placement of Google Search, Chrome, or its GenAI products,” Judge Amit Mehta wrote. “Cutting off payments from Google almost certainly will impose substantial—in some cases, crippling—downstream harms to distribution partners, related markets, and consumers, which counsels against a broad payment ban,” Mehta said.\nGoogle also won’t have to show choice screens on its products, according to the ruling. The determinations were made as part of a broader remedies ruling that does not force Google to divest Chrome or Android, which the Justice Department had wanted. Google will, however, have to share some search data with competitors.\nLast year, Judge Mehta ruled that Google was a monopolist in the search and advertising markets, and this new ruling followed a remedies trial.

Amazon says Lens Live will use an object detection model to identify the products shown on your camera in real-time, and then compare them against the billions of products on its marketplace.\nOnce it finds similar items, Lens Live will display them in a swipeable carousel, where it will also show options to add products to your cart or wishlist.

But he did order Google to share some valuable search information with rivals that could help jumpstart their ability to compete, and bar the search giant from making exclusive deals to distribute its search or AI assistant products in ways that might cut off distribution for rivals.\nIt’s the most significant antitrust remedies ruling against a tech giant in about 25 years, since the DOJ’s case against Microsoft. While it marks a major milestone in the case, it could still be years until Google is actually required to implement these solutions — if ever. Now that Mehta has handed down his remedies ruling, Google can finally appeal his underlying finding that it’s an illegal monopolist. From there, the case could go as far as the Supreme Court.\nGoogle has “concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we’re reviewing the decision closely,” the company’s vice president of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said in a statement. DOJ antitrust chief Gail Slater struck a victorious tone in a statement, but signaled the agency had yet to decide whether to appeal to get more of its requested remedies. “The first Trump administration sued Google to restore competition for millions of Americans subjected to Google’s monopoly abuses. Today, the second Trump administration has won a remedy to do just that,” Slater said. “We will continue to review the opinion to consider the Department’s options and next steps regarding seeking additional relief.”\nLast year, the DOJ submitted a long wish list for breaking Google’s hold over the online search market, and argued that no one solution would be sufficient to truly unlock competition in the space. Its most splashy proposals included requiring Google to sell its Chrome browser, which it sees as a key access point for search engines where Google can prioritize itself, and requiring it to let competitors buy search query data and signals to fuel their own search engines in order to jumpstart competition.\nOver the course of a three-week remedies trial this spring, Mehta heard from Google’s CEO and high-ranking executives from Apple, OpenAI, Perplexity, and traditional search competitors. Google argued that Mehta should only narrowly bar it from certain contract provisions that the judge had found to be exclusionary, and warned that the government’s more lofty proposals could jeopardize user privacy, disincentivize funding for the open-source browser engine Chromium, and unfairly force Google to share knowledge with competitors it had worked hard to earn. Apple and Firefox owner Mozilla, for their parts, warned they could become collateral damage if the judge barred Google from paying them to make its search engine the default on their services.\n\n“The court is highly skeptical that a Chrome divestiture would not come at the expense of substantial product degradation”\n\n\nIn his 230-page ruling, Mehta explained that even though Google’s default status as the search engine on Chrome “undoubtedly contributes to Google’s dominance in general search,” forcing Google to sell it is ultimately “a poor fit for this case.” The DOJ failed to prove that solutions less extreme than a break-up would not be enough to restore competition, he wrote. Furthermore, he says, the DOJ did not prove a causal connection between its monopoly power and Chrome defaults. “But more to the point, there would be nothing ‘natural’ about a Chrome divesture,” Mehta said. “It would be incredibly messy and highly risky.” That’s because it doesn’t run as a “standalone business” and relies greatly on Google’s own infrastructure, he wrote. Even if another owner tried to take it over, he wrote, “the court is highly skeptical that a Chrome divestiture would not come at the expense of substantial product degradation and a loss of consumer welfare.”\nMehta also feared that upending Google’s payments to search distribution platforms would have negative effects rippling across the ecosystem. Banning these kinds of payments to companies like Apple and Mozilla for default placement on their browsers and devices could theoretically “bring about a much-needed thaw,” Mehta said, and even encourage a company like Apple to enter the search market itself. But, he concluded, granting such a remedy risks harming phone and browser makers by denying them significant revenue, while Google gets to keep its money while likely maintaining much of its user base. Though he acknowledged that denying a payments ban is an imperfect solution, Mehta said that “allowing Google to continue making payments is more palatable now than when the liability phase concluded,” since a boom in venture funding for generative AI projects means that “companies already are in a better position, both financially and technologically, to compete with Google than any traditional search company has been in decades (except perhaps Microsoft).”\nDeclining to ban Google from paying for defaults actually “heightened” the need to adopt a remedy that forces Google to share some of its search data with competitors, Mehta noted. “Qualified Competitors will have to continue to compete with Google on price to gain distribution. So, their competitive advantage will have to come from innovation and differentiating their search services from Google’s,” he wrote. To do that, search competitors need scale that they have largely been denied by Google’s search monopoly. So Mehta agreed to let qualified competitors buy at marginal cost a one-time snapshot of a variety of search data that Google collects, which he says will let those rivals “identify and crawl more web pages with valuable content and do so more efficiently.”\nThis remedy is far shy of what the DOJ requested, however. Mehta granted only a narrow subset of the search data the DOJ wanted Google to share with rivals, and only agreed to compel Google to share it once, rather than periodically for the freshest data, which he says, “minimizes the risk of free riding identified by Google’s expert economist and acknowledged by Plaintiffs.” Mehta similarly granted the DOJ’s proposal to require Google to syndicate search results to competitors, but narrowed the scope, allowed Google to price them above marginal cost, and only made the requirement last five years, rather than the 10 the government asked for.\nDuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg, who testified as a search competitor on behalf of the government, said in a statement that Mehta’s ruling would not be effective. “Google will still be allowed to continue to use its monopoly to hold back competitors, including in AI search. As a result, consumers will continue to suffer,” he wrote. “We believe Congress should now step in to swiftly make Google do the thing it fears the most: compete on a level playing field.”\n\n“You don’t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and then sentence him to writing a thank you note for the loot”\n\n\nThe American Economic Liberties Project, a group that’s advocated for stronger antitrust enforcement against the tech industry, slammed Mehta’s ruling as an act of “cowardice.” “You don’t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and then sentence him to writing a thank you note for the loot,” executive director Nidhi Hegde said in a statement. “Similarly, you don’t find Google liable for monopolization and then write a remedy that lets it protect its monopoly. This feckless remedy to the most storied case of monopolization of the past quarter century is a complete failure of his duty and must be appealed.”\nThe DOJ’s complaint was originally filed in 2020, before generative AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT became available to the public. But by the time the remedies trial happened earlier this year, the role AI would play in the future of internet search became a necessary one for Mehta to grapple with. The government implored the judge to make sure the anticompetitive issues with Google’s search business don’t simply shape-shift into its AI offerings.\nGoogle’s empire has faced serious blows from multiple courts this year. In late July, a California appeals court upheld a jury verdict against the company in Epic Games’ lawsuit against its mobile app store monopoly. Earlier this year, a federal judge in Virginia found Google also illegally monopolized the market for some advertising technology tools it offers, and it will return to that court to argue potential remedies for that case in September. Google is still in the middle of these fights, but it’s looking more and more likely that the company’s current form will not last much longer.\nView Link",
