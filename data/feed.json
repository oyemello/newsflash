Wireless charging speeds will drop to 15W for devices that aren’t Qi2.2 compatible. A 45W USB-C power adapter is included so all three wireless charging pads can be used at the same time.\nSlightly cheaper is the $99.99 Belkin UltraCharge 3-in-1 Foldable Magnetic Charger, which offers similar functionality to the Pro but in a design that completely folds flat for travel. Unfolding its magnetic 25W smartphone charger reveals a spot to charge AirPods on its base, while a compact Apple Watch charger folds out from behind its Qi2.2 pad.\nIt also comes with a 45W USB-C power adapter, and will be available in two versions: one with a squared-off design and an alternate with more rounded corners.\nThe $59.99 Belkin UltraCharge 2-in-1 Foldable Magnetic Charger is nearly identical to the 3-in-1 travel model but skips the pop-up Apple Watch charger. In its place is a 5W USB-C port on the base for plugging in the charging cable for other smartwatch models. It will also be available in two different designs and include a 45W power adapter.",

      "raw": "Google’s mystery new speaker appeared briefly in its keynote alongside F1 driver Lando Norris.\t\n\nGoogle announced plenty of new hardware at this week’s Made by Google event, but halfway through we were distracted by the brief appearance of what appeared to be a new, previously unknown Gemini-powered smart speaker. Now Android Headlines claims that this speaker is real, and will launch with new colors and the ability to pair with a Google TV Streamer.\nAndroid Headlines reports that it’s seen additional images of the mystery speaker, which will apparently come in four colors: bright red, light green, black, and white. As seen briefly in the keynote video, it features a light around the base — rather than across the top, as on previous Google speakers — and a fabric finish.\nAs for features, the big new one is that the speaker will apparently be able to pair with a Google TV Streamer to deliver spatial TV audio, a trick borrowed from Apple’s HomePods, which can connect to Apple TV hardware. Hopefully it can also connect to TVs that run the Google TV OS. It will apparently also include new natural voice options, the ability to detect unusual sounds like glass breaking or a smoke alarm, and full support for Matter.\nGemini will deliver the smarts, rather than Google Assistant, which is no surprise. The company announced Gemini for Home this week, which will arrive on existing Nest smart speakers and displays from October this year. It will include a paid tier and support for Gemini Live, though it’s not clear which features will be gated behind the premium subscription.\nAndroid Headlines calls the new hardware the “Home Speaker,” though it’s not clear if that’s its full or final name. We also don’t know when it will be released, though a launch alongside Gemini for Home in the fall seems likely. We’d expect to see an updated smart display before long too, since Google hasn’t updated its Nest Hub line since 2021, and we’ve already found that Amazon’s new Alexa Plus works best on devices with screens.",

Now we can add Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra into the mix.\nThe Trump Mobile team shared an ad to X on Wednesday pushing preorders of the T1, but with an image we’d never seen before. You don’t have to look hard to realize that this is an S25 Ultra that’s been Photoshopped gold with a T1 logo and US flag; looking a little closer confirms that it’s a render of that phone in a Spigen case, right down to the Spigen logo they didn’t bother to remove. \nIt’s a remarkable choice because the S25 Ultra looks even less like the T1 Phone’s official renders than the iPhone the company has previously used in promotions. Even Spigen noticed the dupe, saying what we’re all thinking in its reply on X: “??? bro what”\nThe new X post promises that “The wait is almost over!” for the T1 Phone, which originally advertised launch dates of August and September (one in the press release, the other on the site), but now lists no date at all. The company also no longer claims the phone will be made in the USA, instead saying there are “American hands behind every device.” The phone has shrunk dramatically since launch too, now promising a 6.25-inch screen, way down from the 6.78-inch display described when it was first announced.",

      "raw": "The Splinter Cell: Deathwatch animated series finally has a release date and a proper trailer, but Netflix already wants you to start thinking about what else it has coming down the pipeline.\nDuring this year’s Anime NYC convention, Netflix announced that Deathwatch is slated to debut on October 14th, and the series has added The Sandman‘s Kirby Howell-Baptiste to its cast. Howell-Baptiste will voice Zinnia McKenna, an agent working alongside Sam Fisher (Liev Schrieber) as they’re hunted by squads of trained killers. Though it’s brief, Deathwatch‘s new trailer gives you a pretty solid sense of the series’ slick and brutal action. You can also see that, tonally, the series is going to be a rather serious video game adaptation. But things are going to be a bit different for the next season of Netflix’s take on Devil May Cry.\n\nDue out some time in 2026, Devil May Cry‘s second season will see Dante (Johnny Yong Bosch) and Vergil (Robbie Daymond) reuniting for a battle to the death. In a teaser for the new season, the two brothers actually seem to be having a ball shooting and slashing at each other while humans and demons get caught in the crossfire. It will be interesting to see if the new season really ups its action set pieces when it returns.\n\nThat seems to be the plan for Blue Eye Samurai‘s next season. Along with a scene from Blue Eye Samurai season 2 focused on Mizu (Maya Erskine) storming a stronghold, Netflix shared a behind-the-scenes featurette where series co-creators Amber Noizumi and Michael Green, and executive producer Jane Wu, tease some of what we can expect to see. It looks like Mizu’s quest for revenge will take her all the way to London and involve at least a couple of seemingly-dead characters making unexpected returns. Season 2 is still in production and doesn’t have a firm release date just yet. But you can see from the featurette that the creative team is cooking, especially when it comes to choreographing the show’s action sequences.\nNetflix also shared new trailers for the second half of Sakamoto Days‘ first season, which is currently streaming, and for the third season of Record of Ragnarok, which premiers this December. The big takeaway is that Netflix isn’t easing up on its animated projects. It might be a while before we actually get to see a lot of this new stuff, but hopefully it will be worth the wait.",

      "raw": "To celebrate the launch of ESPN Unlimited, Disney is offering a discounted bundle through January 5th. | Image: Getty Images\t\n\nSo far, 2025 has been a great year for watching new, must-see TV shows and movies on subscription services. But if you, like many of us, have more concurrent subscriptions than you care to admit, you’ll agree that keeping up with the latest stuff every month can get expensive. They may not cost as much as most of the tech we cover, but it adds up.\nIf you’re trying to cut down on your expenses, you might be able to do so while holding onto your precious subscriptions. Attempting to cancel your service is a good way to see if you’ll be offered a cheaper monthly rate to stick around. Outside of that, several services offer promos at different times throughout the year, some of which are even available to new and returning subscribers alike. Below, we’ve curated some of the best deals going on right now, so you can enjoy streaming your favorite show or movie for less than it would typically cost you.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Peacock deals\nThe best Hulu deals\nThe best Sling TV deals\nThe best Apple TV Plus deals\nThe best HBO Max deals\nThe best Netflix deals\nThe best YouTube TV deals\nThe best Paramount Plus and Showtime deals\nThe best Starz deals\nThe best Amazon Prime Video deals\n\nNote: keep an eye out for free trials and student discounts\nMost streaming services offer free trials that typically last from a week to a month, whether you sign up for an annual membership or just a monthly subscription. However, you will likely have to provide your credit card information in advance, and you will be charged once your trial is over, so make a note in your calendar if you don’t want to be charged.\nSome streaming platforms offer student discounts. These include Hulu, Paramount Plus, YouTube TV, Amazon Prime, and more. You’ll have to prove your student eligibility through a sign-up form and typically be enrolled in an accredited Title IV college or university to take advantage of these deals.\nThe best Peacock deals\nPeacock\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $10.99 at Peacock (monthly, with ads)\n $16.99 at Peacock (monthly, with no ads)\n $109.99 at Peacock (annual, with ads)\n\nPeacock is NBCUniversal’s streaming service, one that offers next-day programming from NBC (and Bravo). The platform also provides access to live sports programming, including Sunday Night Football and WWE, as well as movies and shows like The Wild Robot, Conclave, Wicked, Oppenheimer, Yellowstone, Teacup, Saturday Night Live, Rian Johnson’s Poker Face, and The Office spinoff, The Paper, which debuts on September 4th.\nThe platform currently offers two plans: an ad-supported Peacock Premium tier for $10.99 a month (or $109.99 a year) or the ad-free Peacock Premium Plus tier for $16.99 a month (or $169.99 a year). Only the latter lets you download content for offline viewing. These new prices went into effect in late July for new subscribers, and current subscribers will continue paying the previous rate until August 22nd.\nIn terms of deals, things are pretty dry right now. You can grab a complimentary subscription when you sign up for a year of Instacart Plus ($99 annually or $9.99 a month). You can also get free access if you’re an Xfinity Internet customer with gigabit speeds or a Diamond or Platinum Rewards member. If you’re a first responder or a medical professional (and are alright with your credentials being verified by SheerID), you can get Peacock’s monthly plan for $3.99 per month, which is a nice perk.\nThe best Disney Plus deals\nDisney Plus, Hulu Bundle Basic\nThis bundle comes with ads and grants access to all of the shows and movies available in Hulu’s and Disney Plus’ library.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $10.99 at Disney (monthly, with ads)\n\n\nDisney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Unlimited Bundle\nThe bundle grants access to Disney Plus, Hulu, and the new ESPN Unlimited, which includes access to all of ESPN’s networks and services, including ESPN Plus.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $35.99 $29.99 at Disney Plus (with ads)\n $44.99 $38.99 at Disney Plus (without ads)\n\nWith Disney Plus, you can stream a wide range of shows and movies, including Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, Deadpool & Wolverine, Andor, X-Men ‘97, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, and Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour film. A monthly subscription currently costs $9.99 a month with ads or $15.99 a month without (or $159.99 annually). The $15.99 per month service includes Dolby Atmos sound in content that supports it, as well as the ability to download TV shows and movies on up to 10 devices.\nFor just a dollar more, Disney offers an ad-supported, $10.99-a-month Duo Basic subscription that brings together Disney Plus and Hulu. To enjoy an ad-free experience across both services, the cost is $19.99 per month.\nThere’s also the $16.99-a-month Disney Bundle Trio Basic bundle, which includes the ad-supported Hulu and ESPN Plus (paying $26.99 a month nets you the ad-free version of Hulu and Disney Plus, though ESPN will still have ads). That’s cheaper than subscribing to all three streaming services individually, and is the wisest route to take if you want all three.\nNow through January 5th, Disney is celebrating the launch of ESPN Unlimited — a $29.99 streaming service that grants access to all of ESPN’s networks and services, including ESPN Plus — with a discounted bundle. You can currently get a year of Disney Plus and Hulu (with ads), along with ESPN Unlimited, for $29.99 a month, down from $35.99. You can also sign up for an ad-free bundle for $38.99 a month, down from $44.99.\nCarriers are also offering deals on other plans. Those currently on one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans, for instance, can get Disney Plus Trio Basic with ads for $10 a month instead of $16.99. If you already subscribe to Verizon’s existing Legacy bundle, you can also continue to enjoy ad-free Disney Plus, as well as ad-supported ESPN Plus and Hulu, for $15 per month ($6 off).\nThe best Hulu deals\nHulu and Disney Plus (with ads)\nHulu grants access to originals like The Handmaid’s Tale, as well as non-Hulu content like Shogun, The Bear, Futurama, Say Nothing, and Alien: Romulus.  T-Mobile also offering complementary access to the Hulu-ad supported plan when you maintain a qualifying Go5G Next line.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $9.99 at Hulu \n\nHulu offers both ad-supported and ad-free plans. No matter which you sign up for, you’ll be able to access all of Hulu’s TV shows and movies on multiple devices, including originals like The Handmaid’s Tale and Alien: Earth, as well as other content, like Shogun, The Bear, Futurama, and the recent revival of King of the Hill. The service also allows two people to stream simultaneously, and you can have up to six user profiles. However, subscribing to the ad-free plan means you won’t have to deal with commercials; you’ll also be able to watch downloads offline.\nThe ad-supported plan currently costs $9.99 per month, while the ad-free plan costs $18.99 a month. Hulu also sells ad-free and ad-supported bundles that include Disney Plus and / or ESPN Plus, which are cheaper than subscribing to each service individually. With the Hulu with Live TV, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus bundle, you’ll be able to access more than 90 live sports, news, and entertainment channels, as well as content from each of the streaming services. You’ll also be able to record live shows with unlimited DVR storage and take advantage of the same features the standard, ad-free, and ad-supported Hulu plans offer. The ad-supported Hulu with Live TV subscription is $82.99 a month, while the ad-free tier is $95.99 a month (though, it’s worth noting that, of the three services included, ESPN Plus will still have ads, even at this tier). Complicated, right?\nHowever, if you just want Hulu and don’t need the live TV version, you can subscribe to the ad-supported Disney Bundle Duo Basic, which includes Disney Plus, for $10.99 a month. You can also add ESPN Plus for $16.99 per month, or get rid of ads and add live sports for $26.99 a month.\nIn terms of deals, students can subscribe to the ad-supported version for $1.99 a month or a bundle that combines Spotify Premium, Showtime, and ad-supported Hulu for $5.99 a month. Some wireless carriers are also offering customers discounts when they sign up for premium phone plans. As mentioned previously, those currently on one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans can get the Disney Plus Trio Basic with ads for $10 per month instead of $16.99. If you already subscribe to Verizon’s Legacy bundle, you can also continue to stream ad-free Disney Plus and ad-supported ESPN Plus / Hulu for $15 a month ($6 off). T-Mobile, meanwhile, offers complimentary access to Hulu’s ad-supported tier when you maintain a qualifying Go5G Next line. \nThe best Sling TV deals\nSling TV\nSling TV is a live TV streaming service featuring live and on-demand TV channels like CNN, Fox, NBC, Comedy Central, Cartoon Network, and more. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $230 $199 at Sling Orange (five months)\n $230 $199 at Sling Blue (five months)\n $330 $274 at Sling Orange and Blue (five months)\n\nSling TV is a streaming service that functions as a more affordable alternative to YouTube TV and Hulu with Live TV. With it, you can watch a range of streaming services as well as live and on-demand channels — including ESPN, CNN, Fox, NBC, Comedy Central, and Cartoon Network — on multiple devices.\nSling offers an ad-supported free tier — Sling Freestream — which provides access to more than 500 live channels as well as more than 40,000 on-demand movies and TV shows. \nThe platform also offers four paid plans, all of which come with 50 hours of DVR storage: Sling Select ($19.99 a month); Sling Blue ($50.99 a month); Sling Orange ($45.99 a month); and Sling Orange and Blue ($65.99 a month). Sling also lets you subscribe to HBO Max as a Blue-tier add-on for a discount (totaling $57.97 per month), or you can sign up for an ad-free subscription to HBO Max as a standalone service for $16.99 a month. \nSling Select includes access to just 11 channels — including Fox News, NFL Network, National Geographic, and Vice — while select markets also get access to Fox, ABC, and NBC. You can add additional channels, if desired, but you’ll have to pay extra. Sling Orange, meanwhile, is best for sports fans since it includes ESPN channels — but only on one device. Sling Blue, on the other hand, offers a number of channels Sling Orange lacks, including Fox News, MSNBC, E!, Discovery, Bravo, and local NBC or Fox affiliates. You can also subscribe to a bundle that includes both Sling Orange and Sling Blue, which offers all the channels featured in the first two plans.\nRight now, you can save money by signing up for Sling’s new Season Pass, which grants you five months of access to Sling Orange or Sling Blue for $199 ($31 off). Alternatively, you can opt for five months of both packages for $274, which saves you $56 over the course of five months. If you just want temporary access to Sling Orange so you can watch a sports game, Sling also recently introduced Flexible Passes, which include a Day Pass ($4.99), a Weekend Pass ($9.99), and a Week Pass ($14.99). Finally, Sling also offers a Premium Pass, which provides new Sling subscribers access to Paramount Plus with Showtime, Starz, MGM Plus, and AMC Plus.\nThe best Apple TV Plus deals\nApple TV Plus\nApple’s streaming service has a variety of original programming, including live MLB games and standouts like Severance, Ted Lasso, Silo, and Coda. A subscription normally runs $12.99 per month with a seven-day free trial.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $12.99 at Apple \n\nApple TV Plus is a service operated by Apple that offers original shows and movies in 4K HDR, including Ted Lasso, The Studio, The Morning Show, Silo, Severance, Finch, Coda, For All Mankind, and Napoleon. The platform is also the streaming home to Major League Soccer, and currently costs $12.99 a month. There are no ads whatsoever on Apple TV Plus, except for some skippable pre-roll advertisements for other Apple TV Plus content.\nThere are a couple of promos to make note of when it comes to Apple TV Plus. The service currently offers a weeklong free trial for new subscribers, after which you’ll be charged $12.99 a month. You can also get a free three-month subscription when you buy an Apple device, though you’ll have to redeem the offer within 90 days of purchase.\nApple TV Plus is also included in the larger Apple One suite of apps. The all-in-one service lets you bundle four other Apple services for a single monthly subscription starting at $19.95 a month. New subscribers will get a free month of Apple TV Plus if they include it as part of their Apple One membership. In addition, eligible individuals who sign up for the student Apple Music subscription, which starts at $5.99 per month, can get Apple Music for 50 percent off with a free Apple TV Plus subscription.\nAs far as carrier deals go, T-Mobile offers discounts on Apple TV Plus, as well as other streaming services. For instance, the wireless carrier is currently offering customers in the US complimentary access to Apple TV Plus when they subscribe to a qualifying Go5G Next line. For Verizon Unlimited customers, the option exists to get Apple One (which includes Apple TV Plus) for $10 per month (about $10 off) for an individual plan, or $20 for a family plan (about $6 off).\nThe best HBO Max deals\nMax \nHBO Max provides access to shows like Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Dune: Prophecy, The Last of Us, The Penguin  — as well as films like Barbie and Dune — starting at $9.99 a month. AT&T offers complimentary access to the ad-free tier when you subscribe to a select AT&T Unlimited Choice or Plus plan, which starts at $60 per month.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $9.99 at HBO Max (monthly, with ads)\n $99.99 at HBO Max (annual, with ads)\n $169.99 at HBO Max (annual, ad-free)\n\nHBO Max is home to Game of Thrones and its spinoff, House of the Dragon, along with shows and movies like Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Dune: Prophecy, The Last of Us, Wonka, Euphoria, Sinners, Mountainhead, Righteous Gemstones, Hacks, Scavenger’s Reign, The Batman, Succession, and even content from Discovery Plus.\nThe platform offers an ad-supported tier that costs $9.99 a month and two ad-free plans that start at $16.99 a month. Unlike the ad-supported plan, the standard ad-free tier also lets you download 30 shows or movies for offline viewing. HBO Max also offers a $20.99-a-month Premium plan, which allows you to stream in 4K and supports Dolby Atmos with select content. The latter plan also lets you stream on four devices simultaneously and download a maximum of 100 shows or movies to watch on the go.\nHBO Max offers an annual subscription and various bundles, both of which are cheaper than subscribing on a monthly basis. The ad-supported plan normally costs $99.99 a year, saving you a modest $19 over the course of 12 months, while subscribing to the annual ad-free base plan for $169.99 saves you $33. You can also save about $41 by subscribing to the annual 4K Premium ad-free plan for $209.99. Lastly, you can opt for the ad-supported bundle — which includes HBO Max, Disney Plus, and Hulu — for $16.99 a month, or pay $13 extra to go ad-free. The total cost is cheaper than subscribing to each of the three individually, saving you money in the long run. A basic plan exists, with ads, for $9.99 per month.\nMultiple wireless carriers are offering deals. You can, for instance, get a year of Netflix and HBO Max when you purchase a 5G Home Plus, LTE Home Plus, Fios 1 Gig, or the Fios 2 Gig Verizon Home Internet (VHI) plan. Alternatively, Verizon is offering those with an Unlimited plan the ability to get Netflix and HBO Max (with ads) for $10 a month (about $7 off). \nAT&T also includes complimentary access to ad-free HBO Max when you subscribe to select AT&T Unlimited Choice or Plus plans, which start at $60 a month. If you opt for Cricket’s Unlimited Plus 15GB Mobile Hotspot phone plan, which starts at $60 a month, you’ll also be able to get the ad-supported version of HBO Max for free. Finally, you can get two months of HBO Max free with DirecTV Stream or Satellite TV services.\nThe best Netflix deals\nNetflix (monthly, with ads)\nThe well-known streaming service offers individual subscriptions starting at $7.99 a month as well as more premium tiers that allow for 4K resolution and additional users.

It also grants access to the entire Paramount Plus catalog, including shows like Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Yellowstone spinoff 1923, as well as films like Gladiator II and Top Gun: Maverick. You’ll also get access to Showtime’s library, which includes originals like Billions, Dexter: Resurrection, and Yellowjackets, as well as movies like Talk To Me and Past Lives.\nIf you want to subscribe to both Paramount Plus and Showtime, you can sign up for the ad-supported or ad-free Paramount Plus with Showtime package for $12.99 a month.

The annual plan, meanwhile, costs $59.99 per year, saving you $36 over the course of 12 months if you’re willing to pay upfront. Just bear in mind this plan offers fewer live sporting events than the Paramount Plus with Showtime package, and won’t let you download content for offline viewing.\nIn terms of deals, Walmart Plus subscribers can currently get the Essential plan for free as part of their subscription. College students can also subscribe to the Essential plan for $5.99 ($2 off) a month, while seniors with an AARP membership can get a 10 percent discount on the Essential plan or Paramount Plus with Showtime plan.
