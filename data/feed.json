      "raw": "Hyundai’s latest Ioniq 5 model.\t\n\nHyundai is now offering an “optional” security upgrade for the Ioniq 5 in the UK that prevents the car being stolen with a Game Boy-like device. Hyundai wants some Ioniq 5 owners to pay £49 ($65) to upgrade hardware and software components to prevent thieves using handheld devices to unlock and start cars without needing a key.\nKia, Hyundai, and Genesis EVs have been under attack in the UK and elsewhere in recent years thanks to a sophisticated Game Boy-like handheld device that cracks the wireless protocols used by Hyundai Motor Group on vehicles like the Ioniq 5, original Kia EV6, and Genesis GV60.\nHyundai is now offering a paid upgrade for Ioniq 5 owners in the UK, which it promises will address “evolving security threats” with improved software and hardware components for a “customer contribution of £49.” You can check to see if your Ioniq 5 needs this upgrade here, but there hasn’t been a similar bulletin for US vehicles yet.\nIt’s not clear why Hyundai is asking customers to pay for the luxury of having their cars protected against a flaw in Hyundai’s own security mechanisms, particularly as the car maker offers a five-year warranty on its vehicles. We’ve reached out to Hyundai to comment on this security upgrade.\nHyundai’s upgrades are designed to protect against a rise in thieves using a handheld device, which was reportedly designed by hackers in Europe to resemble a Game Boy. It’s been used for at least five years, and works on a variety of cars that use keyless entry systems.\nThe Drive reported in 2020 that the device can intercept the signal emitted when you touch a car’s door handle, allowing it to crack the algorithm and send back a signal so the car thinks a legitimate key is present and unlocks the doors. The same manipulation technique then works to start the car and steal it, and it’s as easy as hitting a button instead of performing a relay attack to amplify the signal of the legitimate key.\n\nWhile these Game Boy-like devices cost around €20,000 in Europe, they’ve been widely used to steal a variety of Kia, Hyundai, Nissan, Gensis, and Mitsubishi cars in recent years. Hyundai’s Ioniq and Kia’s EV6 models were even among the most stolen cars in the UK in 2024, demonstrating just how vulnerable these cars are to this type of attack.\nSecurity researchers also found a flaw in Kia’s web portal last year that allowed attackers to unlock and start cars. It was part of a series of security flaws that have been reported to Hyundai Motor Group, the owners of Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis brands. Hyundai and Kia also agreed to a $200 million settlement in 2023 over the “Kia Boyz” attacks that allowed thieves to bypass a vehicle’s security system using a USB cable.",

      "raw": "AOL dial-up is ending on September 30th according to a statement posted on the company’s website. It marks the end of the service that was synonymous with the internet for many since its launch in 1991. \n“AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet,” reads the statement by the Yahoo-owned company. “This service will no longer be available in AOL plans. As a result, on September 30, 2025 this service and the associated software, the AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser, which are optimized for older operating systems and dial-up internet connections, will be discontinued.”\nYou might be surprised that the service was still operating. I’m not. At last count, a 2019 US census estimated that 265,000 people in the United States were still using dial-up internet, just a few years after I wrote this:\nAs a septuagenarian, my father’s story was typical of long-time AOL dial-up subscribers. His subscription was a security blanket. He was sure he didn’t need the dial-up component, but he didn’t want to risk losing access to his stock portfolio, investor forums, and email. His setup worked, and he could afford to keep paying the subscription he had dutifully paid for over a decade. \nWith my help, we were able to migrate everything he used on AOL to the ad-supported and open internet that was already being delivered into his house via the broadband component of his cable package. Even after things were fully mirrored, he still felt trepidation when the time came to pick up the phone and terminate his dial-up account (despite AOL’s best attempt to obscure and complicate the procedure). Months later he told me he felt silly for letting the ruse go on for so long.\nReading that now and I’m struck to think that the end of AOL dial-up arrives at the same time as Google Zero and the end of the ad-supported internet.",

It's for this reason some scientists are also exploring the potential for life in so-called \"water worlds\" elsewhere in the solar system, like some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. This episode, Regina digs into two water-related hypotheses for the origin on life on Earth — and what that might mean for possible alien life.\nHave another scientific mystery you want us to cover on a future episode?

In May 2025, Israel dismantled the United Nations-led humanitarian aid distribution system in Gaza. In its place came a distribution scheme run by the secretive Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) that came under immediate scrutiny for its “militarised model” and close ties to Israeli authorities, which rights groups warned “undermines the core humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence”.\nIn the months since, humanitarians’ worst fears about the aid sites have been realised. International observers have expressed concern as daily reports emerged of civilians being shot, shelled or crushed while attempting to access aid. Almost 1,400 Palestinians have reportedly been killed while seeking food, primarily near GHF distribution sites.\nIsrael-Gaza war | Benjamin Netanyahu has defended his plan to take control of Gaza City, even as senior UN officials warned the move risked unleashing “another calamity” on the territory. On Sunday, Anas al-Sharif, a prominent Al Jazeera journalist, was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel admitted a deliberate attack on the journalist.\nUkraine | Europe’s leaders have raised the pressure on Donald Trump to involve Ukraine in a planned summit with Vladimir Putin, as Germany warned the White House against any deal hatched “over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians”.\nHousing | Lower-income householders, minority ethnic people and those with young children are more likely to live in homes at risk from dangerous overheating, research has found.\nUK news | Half of the people arrested during the protest in relation to Palestine Action in London on Saturday were aged 60 or above, according to police figures. A total of 532 people were arrested at the largest demonstration relating to the group – all but 10 under section 13 of the Terrorism Act for displaying supportive placards or signs.\nCrime | Foreign criminals from 15 more countries face deportation before they have a chance to appeal, in an expansion of the UK government’s “deport first, appeal later” scheme.\n Continue reading...",
