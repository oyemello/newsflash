      "raw": "AMD’s FSR 4 AI upscaling and frame-generation technology can now be enabled for “most games that support FSR 3.1 with DirectX 12,” the company says in the patch notes for its newest 25.9.1 driver.  This support has been a big promise from AMD, but it’s taken awhile to come to fruition; FSR 4 first launched alongside the company’s RX 9000-series graphics cards back in March.\nAMD touts FSR 4, its competitor to Nvidia’s DLSS 4, as a “significant leap forward” over FSR 3. “By utilizing ML algorithms, FSR 4 can intelligently predict and compensate for lost pixels during low-resolution rendering, thereby providing gamers with high performance and crisp, high-definition visuals that are just as good as native,” AMD says.\nThe new driver brings official FSR 4 support to cover more than 85 titles. But for FSR 3.1 games, you can force FSR 4 by flipping a toggle in the AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition app. “This last step allows the driver to override the FSR 3.1 game implementation with the latest version of FSR 4,” according to AMD. \nFSR 4 support has slowly been trickling out to games since its release, including being added to titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Ghost of Tsushima, and F1 25.",

      "raw": "Nintendo has notched another victory in its crusade against piracy. Last week, a Washington District Court judge ordered Ryan Daley to pay Nintendo $2 million and stop selling modded Switch consoles online, as reported earlier by Engadget.\nIn a copyright lawsuit filed last year, Nintendo accused Daley of operating the website Modded Hardware, which sold modded Switch consoles, modchips used to hack into Switch devices, and Mig flash cartridges that allow people to play pirated copies of games.\nNintendo claimed Daley caused the company “significant and irreparable harm” — and the judge agreed. “The MIG Devices, Mod Chips, Hacked Consoles, and Circumvention Services allow members of the public to create, distribute, and play pirated Nintendo games on a massive scale,” the ruling states. Daley denied any wrongdoing.\nPiracy lawsuits from Nintendo have become increasingly common, with the company winning its case against a file-sharing site accused of hosting pirated games earlier this year. Nintendo’s legal actions have led to the shutdown of Switch emulators, including Yuzu and Ryujinx. The company has also made it clear that it may brick Switch 2 consoles if players try to mod the device.\nDaley, who chose to fight Nintendo without a lawyer, is now banned from modding Switch consoles, as well as from using devices designed to circumvent the console’s security measures. The judge also ordered the seizure, impoundment, or destruction of all devices owned by Daley that may contain copyright-infringing material.",

      "raw": "You can get a great budget device these days if you know how to pick your priorities. | Image: The Verge\t\n\nSome of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets. They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.\nBudget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever. You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world.\nWhat compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.\n\nThe best cheap iPhone\nThe best Android phone under $500\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nOther budget phones to consider\n\nThe best cheap iPhone\niPhone 16E\nThe iPhone 16E is the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, bringing flagship-level performance for less than the standard 16. We really wish it included MagSafe for $599, but those upgrading from older iPhones will probably be satisfied with what’s included.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nReliable performance\nGood, if limited, camera system\nIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy\n\nNo MagSafe\n$599 feels like $100 too much\nNo ultrawide\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 at Apple\n $599.99 at Best Buy\n $599.99 at Verizon\n\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nIf I were making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly cheap. If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.\nThere’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.\nAnother heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming and the most interesting bits won’t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.\nRead my full iPhone 16E review.\nThe best Android phone under $500\nGoogle Pixel 9A\nThe Pixel 9A adds more robust water resistance and a brighter, bigger screen to what was already a winning formula for a good midrange phone.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nRobust IP68 rating\nSeven years of software updates\nBrighter, bigger screen\n\nMissing a couple of AI features\nAI is occasionally handy, usually weird\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 at Amazon\n $499 at Best Buy\n $499.99 at Google\n\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nGoogle’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right. \nThe phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also received a slight boost to IP68, which means it can withstand a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.\nThe 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A’s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin.\nRead my full Google Pixel 9A review.\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nOnePlus 13R\nThe OnePlus 13R is a pared-down version of the company’s flagship phone, and it offers excellent battery life and a great screen for the price.\n\n\nScore: 6\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent battery life\nGreat screen for the price\nSix years of security updates\n\nNo wireless charging\nOnly splash-resistant\nFewer OS updates than Google and Samsung\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599.99 $555.99 at Amazon\n $599.99 at Best Buy\n $599.99 at OnePlus\n\nScreen: 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP65\nThe OnePlus 13R isn’t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It’s also a little pricier at $599 — although we’ve seen it on sale for $499 for extended periods of time — but for some people, the 13R’s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best big screens in its class, and many people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you’re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.\nThere’s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won’t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against sprays and rain showers, but it isn’t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won’t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience, especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A.\nRead my full OnePlus 13R review.\nOther budget phones to consider\nThe 2025 Motorola Moto G Power offers a lot despite its starting price of $299.99. It features a 6.8-inch LCD display, a 5,000mAh battery, wireless charging support, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is increasingly rare in 2025. Additionally, the device combines both IP68 and IP69 ratings, meaning it’s rated for both submersion in water and exposure to high-pressure water jets and steam, in addition to full protection from dust.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is another perfectly capable phone that doesn’t quite earn a recommendation here. It’s a little outside the scope of this guide at $649 anyway, but you do get a telephoto lens and a nice, big screen for that price. Still, you’re better off saving a bunch and picking up the Pixel 9A or trying to score a trade-in promo for the newer Galaxy S25. Read our review.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A56 recently launched in the US with a starting price of $499. The device has all the makings of a solid midrange phone, including a 6.7-inch OLED display, a 50-megapixel main camera, an Exynos 1580 chip, and a 5,000mAh battery with 45W wired charging. Although we haven’t tested it yet, it has some pretty stiff competition in the form of the Pixel 9A, which also has a starting price of $499.\nWe got our first glimpse of the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G back at CES 2025. The device features an Nxtpaper matte LCD screen that’s supposed to be easier on your eyes than a traditional LCD, as it reduces your exposure to blue light. It also features a “Max Ink Mode,” which turns the screen monochrome and silences notifications. This, in turn, can help extend the phone’s battery life to multiple days. Read our initial impressions.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A36 5G is another great choice that recently launched in the US for $399.99. The device sports a big OLED display, a decent midrange Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor, and an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance. Samsung is promising six years of OS and security updates, which is a lot in this price range. Compared to the Galaxy A35 5G, which we previously included in this guide but is no longer available, the A36 5G drops the microSD slot for a second SIM card slot. While we haven’t tested the A36 5G, its predecessor offered a good balance of hardware and price, and the latest release sounds just as compelling.\nUpdate, September 8th: Updated pricing / availability.

      "raw": "Google made three major updates to its Gemini-powered products on Monday: The Gemini app now accepts audio files; Search can handle five new languages; and NotebookLM creates reports in the form of blog posts, study guides, quizzes, and more. \nAccording to a Monday post on X by Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and Gemini, audio file compatibility was the “#1 request” to the Gemini app. \nFree Gemini users max out at 10 minutes of audio, and five free prompts each day. AI Pro or AI Ultra users, meanwhile, can upload audio up to three hours in length. All Gemini prompts accommodate up to 10 files across various file formats, including within ZIP files. \nAdditionally, Google Search’s AI Mode has rolled out five new language options: Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese, thanks to the integration of Gemini 2.5 with Search, according to a company blog: “With this expansion, more people can now use AI Mode to ask complex questions in their preferred language, while exploring the web more deeply.” \nThe Gemini-powered NotebookLM software is also getting an update in the form of new report styles in over 80 languages based on a user’s uploaded documents, files, and other media. \n(While the Gemini app is just now getting audio, NotebookLM already had that capability, positioning itself as a research tool that helps find patterns in files of different formats.)\nThe standard report formats include study guides, briefing docs, and blog posts. Flashcards and quizzes are also included in the latest NotebookLM update. Users can choose the self-created format and adjust the structure, tone, and style of the report. The feature “should be 100%” available by the end of this week, according to a company comment to a post on X.\nGoogle has been on a dizzying spree of AI-related features in the past month. Gemini began automatically recalling user details and preferences from past conversations in August, the same month that free users gained access to Workspace’s video generation software Vids. In September, Photos upgraded to the latest video generation software Veo 3 and gave free users the ability to create silent 4-second long videos from their own personal, still pictures.",

On that free tier, you’ll also be able to save your text messages past then, and while you’ll be limited to saving 100MB of messages, Signal expects that will still “be large enough for even heavy Signal users to back up the text of all of their messages,” according to O’Leary.\nThe backup archives are “stored without a direct link to a specific backup payment or Signal user account,” O’Leary says. You’ll use a recovery key to unlock your backups, but if you lose that key, the company “cannot help you recover it.” If you turn on secure backups, your device will make a new backup every day.\nThe feature is available on Android’s beta app, and a public launch and iOS and desktop support are “coming soon.” Down the line, Signal plans to let users save a secure backup archive to “the location of your choosing.”",

      "raw": "It’s been five years since Polestar first introduced the Precept, a concept car that the electric automaker described as “a manifesto of things to come; a declaration.” Well, come they have, because today Polestar finally revealed the production car that’s based on this manifesto: the Polestar 5.\nAnd wow, these specs: up to 460 miles of range, 800-volt architecture for ultra-fast charging, 884 horsepower, 0–60mph in an oomph-inducing 3.1 seconds for the Performance trim. It certainly makes those five years feel like worth the wait.\nIn final form, the Polestar 5 is an absolutely stunning fastback sedan with dramatic proportions that are sized similarly to the Porsche Panamera. The 5 will be built on a bespoke supercar-like bonded aluminum platform that’s was developed at Polestar’s own facility in England. And like the Polestar 4, it lacks a rear window, relying instead on a high-definition rearview camera.\nThere’s a lot more, so let’s dig into it. \nPower\nAt launch, there will be two versions of the Polestar 5: a Dual Motor trim with 748hp (550kW), 599lb-ft of torque (812 Newton-meters), and a 0–60mph time of 3.8 seconds; and a Performance package with 884hp (650kW), 749lb-ft (1,015Nm) of torque, and 0–60mph acceleration in 3.1 seconds. Both versions are speed-limited to a maximum of 155mph — seemingly in the spirit of former parent company Volvo’s safety maxim of limiting vehicle max speed to 112mph.\nThe 800-volt architecture is new to Polestar, and should enable 350kW charging when plugged into a suitable charger. That means 10–80 percent charging in “as little” as 22 minutes, the company says. Owners can expect a WLTP estimated range of 670km (416 miles) for the Dual Motor trim and 565km (351 miles) for the Performance one.\nThe Polestar 5’s battery contains 112kWh of energy, 106kWh of which is usable. The SK One-supplied NMC (nickel cobalt manganese) pack consists of eight modules with 192 cells. And its design forms part of the 5’s steel structure, which Polestar says brings safety benefits.\nDesign\nThe Polestar 5 is built on the company’s Polestar Performance Architecture (PPA), which uses a bespoke, hot-cured aluminum structure for improved weight and rigidity. That frame consists of 13 percent recycled aluminum and 83 percent aluminum from smelters (no word on the remaining 4 percent), which helps lower the 5’s carbon footprint when compared to standard sourcing.\n(Keep in mind that Polestar has positioned itself as one of the few automotive startups that still gives a shit about climate change. The company’s CEO recently used his keynote at the IAA Mobility conference in Munich, where the Polestar 5 will make its debut, to urge EU leaders to stick to their strict zero-emission goals.)\nThe Performance variant is slated to have a sport-tuned suspension with semi-active dampers. There are also bespoke Michelin tires, designed specifically for the Polestar 5, ranging from 20 to 22 inches depending on the trim level.\nInside, you’ll find a 14.5-inch portrait display alongside a 9-inch instrument cluster behind the steering wheel. To cut down on distractions, there will be a 9.5-inch heads-up display projected on the windshield. And a driver-monitoring camera makes sure the driver keeps their eyes on the road while the driver assist system is engaged.\n\nThe Performance variant is slated to have a sport-tuned suspension with semi-active dampers.\n\n\nThe front fascia features Polestar’s SmartZone, which consists of many of the vehicles’ sensors, like radar and the front parking camera. In total, the Polestar 5 has 11 vision cameras, one driver monitoring camera, one mid-range radar, and 12 ultrasonic sensors. (Unlike the Polestar 3 and 4, the 5 won’t feature a lidar sensor.) The vehicle also uses interior radars to detect the number, position, and type of occupants to “deploy the correct safety measures in the event of an accident.”\nThere’s a lot of high-end brand names scattered throughout this announcement: Brembo for braking, Bowers & Wilkins for a premium audio system, and Bridge of Weir nappa leather as an optional interior. The driver-assist system is powered by Mobileye, while the infotainment system runs on Google’s embedded Android software.\nWhile designed as a four-seater, the rear arm rest can be lifted to accommodate a fifth passenger. Polestar cut out a space in the battery, known as the foot garage, behind the front seats to give occupants an extra foot of space for a more natural seating position.\nAvailability\nPolestar didn’t reveal an exact launch date — customer deliveries are planned for the first half of 2026 — or starting price for the 5, only to say they are coming soon. Suffice it to say it won’t be cheap. The Performance version of the grand tourer is expected to start somewhere north of $100,000 in North America.\nThe company has had a strong sales year so far, thanks to some deep discounts, including one geared toward converting former Tesla owners. The company makes the Polestar 2 electric fastback, the Polestar 3 electric SUV, and the Polestar 4 electric SUV coupe. \nTariffs are sure to take a toll on the Geely-owned, Swedish-designed company’s future. Polestar manufactures in the US and China, and plans to make the Polestar 4 in South Korea in the second half of 2025. It hasn’t said where the 5 will be built, so that will be one to watch. \nBut despite these challenges, Polestar is charging ahead. First shown last spring as the O2 concept, the Polestar 6 will be the brand’s next flagship model, taking the form of a two-door sports car with a convertible roof. And when the 6 goes on sale (presumably in 2026), it will use the same architecture and powertrains as the Polestar 5.",

      "raw": "An old screenshot of Nova Launcher. | Image: Nova Launcher\t\n\nAfter nearly everyone working on the Nova Launcher, one of the most recognizable names in Android launchers, was laid off last year, founder Kevin Barry, Nova’s sole remaining developer, said this weekend that he has left Nova’s parent company after being asked to stop working on the launcher and an effort to open-source it. Nova Launcher’s website currently shows a 404 error, though the launcher is still available on Google Play.\nMobile analytics company Branch Metrics acquired Nova in 2022. The company’s CEO at the time, co-founder Alex Austin, said on Reddit that if Barry were to leave Branch, “it’s contracted that the code will be open-sourced and put in the hands of the community.” Austin left Branch in 2023, and now with Barry officially gone from the company, too, it’s unclear if the launcher will now actually be open-sourced.\nBarry declined to comment to The Verge. We’ve reached out to Branch for comment.\n“I think the newer leadership since Alex Austin left has put a different focus on the company and Nova simply isn’t part of that focus in any way at all,” Cliff Wade, Nova’s former customer relations lead who left as part of the 2024 layoffs, tells The Verge. “It’s just some app that they own but no longer feel they need or want.”\nWade also said that “I don’t believe Branch will do the right thing any time soon with regards to open-sourcing Nova. I think they simply just don’t care and don’t want to invest time, unless of course, they get enough pressure from the community and individuals who care.” Users have started a change.org petition to ask for the project to be open-sourced, and Wade says it’s a “great start” to apply that pressure. Wade said he hasn’t personally seen Barry’s contract, so couldn’t corroborate the claim of a contractual obligation to open-source Nova.\nStill, he said that the community “deserves” for the launcher to be open-sourced. “Branch just simply needs to do the right thing here and honor what they as a company have stated as well as what then CEO Alex Austin has stated numerous times prior to him leaving Branch.”\nAdditional reporting by Dominic Preston.",

      "raw": "For months, Google has maintained that the web is “thriving,” AI isn’t tanking traffic, and its search engine is sending people to a wider variety of websites than ever. But in a court filing from last week, Google admitted that “the open web is already in rapid decline,” as spotted earlier by Jason Kint and reported on by Search Engine Roundtable.\nGoogle submitted the filing ahead of another trial that will determine how it will address its monopoly in the advertising technology business. The US Department of Justice recommends that Google break up its advertising business, but the company argues in the filing that this isn’t ideal because it would “only accelerate” the decline of the open web, “harming publishers who currently rely on open-web display advertising revenue.”\nGoogle:\nFinally, while Plaintiffs continue to advance essentially the same divestiture remedies they noticed in their complaint filed in January 2023, the world has continued to turn. Plaintiffs put forth remedies as if trial, the Court’s liability decision, and remedies discovery never happened—and also as if the incredibly dynamic ad tech ecosystem had stood still while these judicial proceedings continued. \nBut the changes have been many: AI is reshaping ad tech at every level; non-open web display ad formats like Connected TV and retail media are exploding in popularity; and Google’s competitors are directing their investments to these new growth areas. The fact is that today, the open web is already in rapid decline and Plaintiffs’ divestiture proposal would only accelerate that decline, harming publishers who currently rely on open-web display advertising revenue. As the law makes clear, the last thing a court should do is intervene to reshape an industry that is already in the midst of being reshaped by market forces.\nThe statement sharply contrasts Google’s recent narrative about the health of search on the web. Google has a clear incentive to make itself appear weaker or less monopolistic in the courtroom, but its admission reflects a reality many publishers are going through. Several digital publishers and independent website owners have reported experiencing a decline in traffic following changes to Google Search’s algorithm and the rise of AI chatbots. \nIn an emailed statement to The Verge, Google spokesperson Jackie Berté said the statement is “one cherry-picked line that misrepresents” the company’s legal filing. “It’s clear from the preceding sentence that we’re referring to ‘open-web display advertising’ and not the open web as a whole,” Berté said. “We are pointing out the obvious: that investments in non-open web display advertising like connected TV and retail media are growing at the expense of those in open web display advertising.”\nWhen asked about changes to web traffic during an episode of Decoder in May, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is “definitely sending traffic to a wider range of sources and publishers” following the rollout of AI search tools.\nNick Fox, Google’s senior vice president of knowledge, similarly defended Google against claims that changes to search are impacting web traffic. “From our point of view, the web is thriving,” Fox said on an episode of the AI Inside podcast. In the wake of a report from Pew Research, which said people are “less likely” to click on links when presented with Google’s AI Overview, Google Search head Liz Reid claimed that click volume has remained “relatively stable” when compared to the same time last year, adding that Google continues to “send billions of clicks to websites every day.”\nView Link\nUpdate, September 8th: Added a statement from Google.",

The new whistleblowers are being represented by legal nonprofit Whistleblower Aid, which also worked with Haugen. \nIn a statement, Meta spokesperson Dani Lever said the allegation its legal team sidelined research is based on a few examples “stitched together to fit a predetermined and false narrative; in reality since the start of 2022, Meta has approved nearly 180 Reality Labs-related studies on social issues, including youth safety and well-being.” Lever said Meta research has led to “significant product updates” including parent supervision tools, and that its VR devices are made for people over 13.\nThe allegations are expected to take center stage at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday called “Hidden Harms: Examining Whistleblower Allegations that Meta Buried Child Safety Research.” Three Republicans on that committee have already asked Meta for more information on its protections for kids and teens on its Horizon Worlds virtual platform. \nAlso on Monday, the former head of security at Meta-owned WhatsApp filed a lawsuit accusing the company of ignoring privacy and security issues that allegedly endangered users’ information, The New York Times reported. WhatsApp spokesperson Carl Woog called the lawsuit “a familiar playbook in which a former employee is dismissed for poor performance and then goes public with distorted claims that misrepresent the ongoing hard work of our team.”\nUpdate, September 8th: Added information about the WhatsApp lawsuit.",
