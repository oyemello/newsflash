Follow today’s news live\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nThe Nationals leader David Littleproud has joined several leading Liberals in calling for Jacinta Nampijinpa Price to apologise to the Indian community for her remarks that the government was only allowing them into the country because they would vote Labor.\nAsked on ABC’s 7.30 whether Nampijinpa Price should apologise, Littleproud said:\nYeah, I think she should. I think she’s admitted that she’s made a mistake. She regrets it. But I think it’s the right thing to do to simply say – you’ve made a mistake, I’m sorry for any offence that I’ve caused, and move on.\nWe all make mistakes in life, and I think it’s important that, when you do, you own up to them...

      "raw": "Apple’s new iPhone Air contains more recycled titanium than any of its predecessors, the company announced at the Tuesday Keynote. It’s using 80 percent recycled titanium. The phone as a whole is made with 35 percent recycled material by weight, compared to 30 percent recycled material for the iPhone 17. \nThe iPhone Air incorporates a thinner, 3-D printed titanium USB-C port to match the phone’s slim design. That strategy uses 33 percent less material than a typical forging process, according to Apple.   \nThe company’s latest lineup of watches also boast higher proportions of recycled content. The Apple Watch Ultra 3, Apple Watch SE 3, and Series 11 are made up of 40 percent recycled content, with 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery. The Ultra 3 case is made with 100 percent recycled titanium, and Apple says that an “innovative 3D printing process” allowed it to cut down the amount of raw materials used in the case by half compared to previous iterations. The Apple Watch SE 3 case is made with 100 percent recycled aluminum. The Series 11 case is made with either 100 percent recycled titanium or aluminum.\nFor comparison, Apple’s Series 10 watch cases came with either 100 percent recycled aluminum or 95 percent recycled titanium. Using more recycled materials can minimize the pollution and environmental risks of mining and processing raw materials, as does designing products to have more longevity.\nUpdate, Sep. 9th: This post has been updated with more information about the iPhone Air and Apple Watch lineup.",

First announced at WWDC 2025, watchOS 26 has already been available to developers and those willing to try the public betas, but starting on September 15th it will be available to everyone — or at least those with an Apple Watch Series 6 or onward, the second-generation Apple Watch SE, or any of the premium Apple Watch Ultra models.\nOne of the simplest but potentially most useful upgrades arriving with watchOS 26 is the new wrist flick gesture. It will be limited to the Apple Watch Series 9 or later, but by flicking your Apple Watch away and back again, you can quickly dismiss incoming calls and notifications, silence timers and alarms, or jump back to your watchface. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by audible notifications, watchOS 26 can track ambient noise levels and automatically adjust their volume so they’re not as loud in quiet situations.\nA new Apple Intelligence-powered Workout Buddy leverages your health data and recent physical activity to provide personalized insights, including letting you know how close you are to a specific goal or if you’ve set a personal record. Other watchOS 26 upgrades powered by Apple Intelligence include automatic two-way translations in Messages and contextual app suggestions in the Smart Stack — like starting a workout — based on the time or your location.\nApple is also finally bringing its Notes app to the Apple Watch through watchOS app, letting you create new notes, pin existing ones, or check off entries on a list. The Apple Watch will also look a bit different after the update thanks to Apple’s new Liquid Glass design language, which will bring a transparent aesthetic to many UI elements like widgets, notifications, Control Center, and even watchfaces.",
