To fund the repayment, we plan to draw on the approximately $300 million in cash we expect to receive from the reversion and settlement of our U.S. pension fund (the Kodak Retirement Income Plan, or “KRIP”) in December. However, the KRIP reversion is not solely within Kodak’s control and therefore is not deemed “probable” under U.S. GAAP accounting rules, which is what triggered the “going concern.” Once the KRIP reversion is completed Kodak will be virtually net debt free and will have a stronger balance sheet than we have had in years.”",

The device shows the name Kindle Petit Color in the corner of one image, although the post author says that name hasn’t been finalized yet.\nThe Redditor says the screen’s colors are “much better than the Colorsoft” and the prototype lets you adjust the intensity and saturation of individual colors. The size of the device’s screen bezels are similar to Amazon’s entry-level black-and-white Kindle, but they claim it will actually be a little smaller than the 11th-generation version of the e-reader. \nAccording to the post’s author, the prototype’s user interface takes better advantage of its color E Ink screen, letting you change the colors of the battery, Wi-Fi, and shopping cart icons, as well as the reading progress status bar. The text of an ebook can also be colored and will dynamically transition from one color to another through four different shades as you progress through a book, giving you another visual clue as to when you’re near the end.\nThese images and details are unconfirmed, and while Amazon has been expanding its lineup of color-screen Kindles, you should take this leak with more than a few grains of salt.",

      "raw": "Apple is developing a bunch of products and features to deliver its vision of AI, including multiple robots, a smart home display, and a revamped version of Siri with new technology powering it, according to an extensive report from Bloomberg. The company’s generative AI efforts lag those from other big tech companies, and  it delayed some upgrades to Siri earlier this year, but these rumored new initiatives point to  the smart home as a key place for its AI technology\nOne of the robots is apparently a tabletop robot that “resembles” an iPad mounted to an arm that can move around and follow users as they move around a room, Bloomberg says. Apple has already shared a preview of what this could look like: earlier this year, the company published research showing a tabletop robot that looks like a real-life version of the Pixar logo with a lamp on the end of the arm. In videos, it’s quite charming — it can even dance. \nA key part of the device, which Apple is aiming to launch in 2027, would be a more visual version of Siri that users could have more natural conversations with, like what’s possible with ChatGPT’s voice mode. Bloomberg says Apple has tested using an animated take on the Finder logo for Siri, but the company is also apparently thinking about ideas that are more like Memoji. Apple is also revamping Siri so that it’s powered by LLMs.\nApple is working on other robots, too, including an Amazon Astro-like robot that has wheels, and it has “loosely discussed” humanoid robots, according to Bloomberg.\nBy the “middle of next year,” Apple plans to launch a smart home display that will let you do things like control your smart home, play music, take notes, and do video calls, Bloomberg says, and this device could have the new look for Siri. The display and the tabletop robot may have a new OS that can be used by multiple people, and could be able to personalize what’s shown to a user by scanning their face with a front-facing camera. Bloomberg says the smart home screen resembles a Google Nest Hub but has a square display.\nIn addition to the smart home display, Apple is also working on a security camera, and it plans to develop “multiple types of cameras and home-security products as part of an entirely new hardware and software lineup,” Bloomberg says.",

      "raw": "New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing the banks behind Zelle over claims that their payment platform enabled “massive amounts of fraud” that caused customers to lose more than $1 billion between 2017 and 2023. In the lawsuit, James alleges Zelle was rushed to market, resulting in a design that made the platform “an obvious conduit for fraudulent activity.”\nEarly Warning Services (EWS), a company owned by major institutions including Bank of America, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and others, launched Zelle in 2017 as a way to let customers send money from their bank account to other users on the platform. However, James claims EWS “knew from the beginning that key features of the Zelle network made it uniquely susceptible to fraud” and still “failed to adopt basic safeguards.”\nOne of the alleged issues highlighted by James’ lawsuit includes a registration process that ”lacked important verification steps” that enabled scammers to sign up using misleading email addresses, which they could use to pose as a government employee or business to trick Zelle customers into sending them money that they couldn’t get back. Following government pressure, Zelle began paying back victims of imposter scams in 2023.\nAdditionally, James claims EWS did not ensure that banks reported customer complaints about fraud in a “timely” manner and falsely advertised the service as a “safe” money transfer tool. “Even when EWS did receive reports of fraud, it failed to promptly remove the fraudsters from the Zelle network or require banks to reimburse consumers for certain scams,” James alleges.\nThe lawsuit touches on many of the same points as the one initially filed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In March, the CFPB dropped its lawsuit against Zelle amid the Trump administration’s attempt to dismantle the agency and the firing of former head Rohit Chopra, who had taken an aggressive approach to tech regulation. That still hasn’t stopped scrutiny from federal lawmakers — and now, New York’s attorney general.\nZelle spokesperson Eric Blankenbaker pushed back on these claims in a statement to The Verge, saying Zelle “leads the fight to stop fraud and scams” in the US. “This lawsuit is a political stunt to generate press, not progress,” Blankenbaker says. “The Attorney General wants to hand criminals a blueprint for guaranteed payouts with no consequences, opening the floodgates to more scams, not less. That’s bad policy and puts consumers at greater risk.”\nAttorney General James claims EWS violated New York law and is asking for restitution and damages for all New Yorkers harmed by scams on Zelle. “I look forward to getting justice for the New Yorkers who suffered because of Zelle’s security failures,” James said in the press release.",

The most notable update, thanks to product shots shared by reliable leaker Roland Quandt, is a new square design for the camera, which has previously been pill-shaped. It will also supposedly be called the Insta360 Go Ultra, instead of the Insta360 Go 4 had the company stuck with its previous naming convention.\nAccording to the leaks, the Insta 360 Go Ultra measures a little over an inch on each side (30mm) with the lens located in the corner of the camera. It weighs 53 grams, which is quite a bit heavier than the 35.5 gram Go 3 and 26.5 gram Go 2, but the Go Ultra features a new 1/1.28-inch sensor and 4K/60fps video capabilities. That’s twice the framerate of the updated Go 3S that was introduced about a year ago.\nThe camera will feature stabilization and a horizon lock feature, as well as an Active HDR mode that can capture more vivid videos when recording at 4K/30fps. The Go Ultra will also include a redesigned Action Pod dock that includes a flip-up screen for live previews and doubles as a wireless remote. It will also boost the Go Ultra’s runtime, but specific details about the new camera’s battery life aren’t known yet.\nAs for a potential release date? Previous iterations of the Insta 360 Go have debuted in June and even earlier, but leaks haven’t yet revealed when the company plans to officially launch the latest version.",
