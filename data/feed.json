      "raw": "Boox isn’t quite ready to reveal everything about its next Palma e-reader, but we got a sneak peek. | Photo: Jess Weatherbed / The Verge\t\n\nIt wasn’t on public display at its IFA 2025 booth, but Boox gave The Verge’s Jess Weatherbed a brief but early look at its next Palma smartphone-sized e-reader. The company wasn’t yet willing to divulge any technical specs. Still, the new Palma appears to feature a color E Ink screen, and the device’s status bar also shows a 4G+ LTE cellular connection, seemingly indicating the next Palma could also be a fully-functional smartphone.\nThe two previous versions of the Android-powered Boox Palma both feature a 6.13-inch black and white e-paper screen, but Boox was one of the earliest adopters of E Ink’s color screen technology and introduced color e-readers long before Amazon and Kobo.\nBut a color screen isn’t the most requested feature amongst Palma fans. The pocketable e-readers have only offered Wi-Fi connectivity so far. Their functionality has come close to replicating an Android phone, featuring dual microphones and even a camera on the back. But you lose connectivity if you leave the house without a hotspot. \nIt’s not yet known if the next Palma will include a SIM card tray, rely on eSim, or what cellular networks it will be compatible with. But like the Bigme Hibreak Pro that was announced earlier this year, it could be a true smartphone replacement for those wanting a more distraction-free experience (browsing social media on an E Ink screen still isn’t easy on the eyes) or better battery life.",

See, Signal automatically detects when your internet goes down and switches your whole Wi-Fi network over to a cellular connection to minimize disruption. Sure, when I’d suddenly see a “Slack is trying to connect” message, I could pull out my phone and hop on the hotspot, but that only brought my laptop back online. My TVs, the computer in my studio, my kid’s iPad, these all stayed connected to the now useless router. \nThe Eero Signal comes in two versions: a 4G LTE model for $99.99 and a 5G RedCap one for $199.99. But you’ll also need an Eero Plus subscription ($9.99 a month, or $99.99 a year), which gets you 10 GB of backup data per year. If your wired internet is particularly unreliable, it might be worth considering an upgrade to Eero Plus 100, which gets you 100GB of backup data for $199.99. \nAll of this is only useful to you if you’ve bought into the whole (rather pricey) Eero ecosystem. Otherwise, you might need to stick to your phone’s hotspot when the next storm takes out a telephone pole.",

      "raw": "Elon Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire if Tesla shareholders approve a new pay package that was just put forward by the company’s board. \nMusk would need to meet certain milestones in order to receive that eye-popping compensation, such as producing 1 million robotaxis and 1 million humanoid robots, as well as increase Tesla’s valuation by trillions of dollars. Musk, already the world’s richest man, would ascend to new heights of financial untouchability if he is able to achieve these goals. \nThe proposal builds on an interim award of $29 billion that was announced last month. In total, the package is worth approximately $975 billion based on maximum payout. And it would give Musk more control over the company, which he has demanded in order to achieve his vision for AI-powered cars and robots.\n\nMusk would need to meet certain milestones in order to receive that compensation\n\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Tesla has tried throwing a bunch of cash at Musk to keep him focused on the company. The company offered him a pay package worth more than $50 billion in 2018, but last year a Delaware court voided it, arguing that the deal was flawed and unfair to shareholders and that Musk held undue influence over its composition. Shareholders had voted twice to approve the hefty compensation, but the judge still upheld their ruling that blocked it. Tesla has appealed the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court.\nNow, the company is asking shareholders to approve this new award, arguing that Tesla is on the cusp of becoming a leader in AI and robotics, requiring Musk’s steady hand on the helm.\n“We believe that Elon’s singular vision is vital to navigating this critical inflection point,” Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders. “We also recognize the formidable nature of this undertaking and as a result, the importance of having a leader who is not only willing and capable but eager to meet this challenge.”\nThe pay package amounts to a huge vote of confidence at a time when Musk’s political meddling has taken an enormous toll on the electric car company that is the source for his vast wealth. Tesla’s sales have declined significantly across the globe as rising competition from China, as well as Musk’s vocal support for far-right politics, have diminished the company’s brand. And yet, Tesla’s stock has always outperformed its reality as an electric car and renewable energy company, which has led some critics to deride it as meme stock.\nTo secure this vast payout, Musk would need to stay as CEO of Tesla for at least seven years, or up to 10 years in order to receive the full amount. During that time, he would need to deploy 1 million robotaxis into commercial service, as well as 1 million Optimus robots, all while growing the company’s market capitalization by trillions of dollars and creating “nearly $7.5 trillion in value for shareholders.” Musk and his brother Kimbal, both board members, recused themselves from the proposal, according to the filing.\nAfter years of growth, the sudden reversal in Tesla’s fortune has left many investors and supporters with whiplash. As Musk slid deeper into politics, investors urged him to stay focused on Tesla and its costly — and questionable — project to build more self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The company rolled out its first robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, this summer — although the service fell short of Musk’s earlier predictions. The company’s only new product since 2020, the Cybertruck, has widely been considered a flop. And competition from legacy automakers, especially those in China, has been sapping Tesla’s resources.\nMusk is currently Tesla’s largest shareholder, with a 13 percent stake in the company. But the CEO has said that he wants more control over the company in order to have more sway over its mission — which this plans aims to produce.\n“That is a major concern for me, as I’ve mentioned in the past, and I hope that is addressed at the upcoming shareholders meeting,” Musk said in a recent earnings call, in response to a question about his voting stake. “I think my control of Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”",

      "raw": "The Switch 2 can be enjoyed right out of the box, but it’s even better with the right accessories. Some of these add-ons are more crucial than others, especially if you’re deciding what to buy early on. For example, a case and a screen protector can keep your console safe from scuffs, scratches, and drops, so both are what I’d consider to be essential. \nOn the other hand, a microSD Express card lets you add even more digital games to your library, although the console’s somewhat generous 256GB of internal storage means you may not need one right away (unless you buy a lot of games that are 50-70GB each, such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Madden 26). Some other accessories don’t add enough to the gaming experience to be worth it. Those Joy-Con 2 steering wheel accessories? You can pass on those.\nThe Switch 2 and its games are expensive enough, so we’ve assembled this guide with picks that are a great value. You don’t need to spend hundreds on accessories — many of us at The Verge certainly aren’t. No matter your budget, we’ve included numerous categories, beginning with a starter kit of recommendations we think everyone should consider.\nOur seven must-have Switch 2 accessories\namFilm OneTouch two-pack of glossy screen protectors\nThis two-pack of glossy screen protectors is a great value.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $15.99 $8.99 at Amazon\n\ntomtoc slim carrying case for the Switch 2\nA slim, durable case that comes in multiple color schemes.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $47.99 $30.99 at Amazon\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller\nThe Switch 2 wireless controller with the most features, but it’s not cheap.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $89 at Walmart\n $89.99 at Best Buy\n $89 at Amazon\n\n8BitDo USB Adapter 2\nGrab this to be able to use your Xbox or PS5 controller on your Switch 2.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $19.99 $16.99 at Amazon\n $19.99 $17.99 at 8BitDo\n $19.99 $16.99 at Best Buy\n\nSandisk microSD Express card\nOnce you’ve filled up the Switch 2’s built-in 256GB SSD, add some extra storage.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $53.99 at Amazon (128GB)\n $71.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $119.99 $116.99 at Amazon (512GB)\n\nUgreen USB-C-to-ethernet adapter\nSwitch 2 Wi-Fi download speeds are painfully slow.

It’s similar in several ways to the excellent Pro controller that debuted alongside the Switch, especially in design, with its analog stick layout, and because it’s the most replete with features you won’t find on other Switch 2 gamepads. \nIts motion control support isn’t a novel feature (many third-party controllers offer that), but its Amiibo NFC support is still something that almost no alternatives offer. Another feature that makes this one worth considering despite its high price is its 3.5mm headphone jack, in case you want to plug in a set of wired headphones for private listening. Additionally, it can wake the Switch 2 from standby via Bluetooth (only a select few wireless models possess this ability), so you don’t have to get off your couch to hit the console’s power button. Lastly, this model has two additional buttons that can be mapped to mimic almost any other button. (some cheaper alternatives, including the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 and Pro 3, feature four extra buttons).\nThe Switch 2 Pro is very comfortable, and it’s the controller that I always want to use when given the choice between the options below. But it’s not perfect. For one, it’s pricey at $89.99, and you’d think for that price Nintendo might have opted for drift-resistant sticks. Alas, you owe $5 to your buddy who bet that Nintendo would doggedly opt again for potentiometer sticks that are proven to tear down over time. Its sticks haven’t caused issues — so far — but it’s possible that they might not fare as well, and for as long, as models below that feature more durable Hall effect or TMR joysticks.\nRead our review of the Switch 2 Pro\nNintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller\nThe Switch 2 Pro Controller features new remappable “GL” and “GR” rear buttons, the “C” button to access in-game chat features, and a headphone jack.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $89 at Walmart\n $89.99 at Best Buy\n $89.99 at Target\n\n8BitDo Pro 3\n8BitDo’s Pro 3 is a good alternative to the Switch 2 Pro controller: it’s slightly cheaper, yet better in some ways (and a bit worse in others) that might matter to you. \nStarting with the good, the company upgraded its joysticks to the even more durable TMR sensors. The two back paddles are carried over from the first iteration, though there’s a new pair of buttons (L4 and R4) near the triggers that can be customized. Also of note are new toggle switches around its backside (similar to what we saw on the DualSense Edge) that let you alter the travel distance of its two triggers. Toggling a switch makes the corresponding trigger feel more like a mouse click. \nIt’s also worth noting that this controller is significantly more customizable than the Switch 2 Pro, as well as most other controllers out there. Its face buttons are magnetically attached, and can be removed to let the Pro 3 flip between the Switch layout and the Xbox layout.\nWhile the Pro 3’s TMR sticks might make it last longer, there are some trade-offs compared to the pricier Nintendo alternative — none of which are deal-breakers if saving money is a top priority. For example, its attempts to replicate the subtle blips and buzzing of Nintendo’s impressive HD haptics in the Switch 2 Pro controller are just not good. Its attempts at replicating the smallest, nuanced vibrations of Donkey Kong walking in Bananza makes it go full boar. I’d sooner turn off the vibration entirely than deal with how jarringly intense it feels, and thankfully you can in the app.\nOther downsides are more minor, but are still worth knowing about. It lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, and it doesn’t have the C button to launch GameChat. However, you can easily assign the feature to one of the Pro 3’s buttons via the Switch 2’s OS — but not to its additional buttons (the two R buttons near the triggers, and the two rear paddles). If you’d prefer to use the controller’s built-in button combo to reassign in-game commands to any of its buttons, that’s easy to do, per the instructions in its PDF manual. \nRead our review of the 8BitDo Pro 3\n8BitDo Pro 3 controller\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 $63 at Amazon (via on-page coupon)\n\n8Bitdo USB Adapter 2\nIt’s technically not a controller, but I’m a broken record when it comes to recommending 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2 for households already with more than one console. In the case that you have an Xbox or a PS5 and would rather not buy a bespoke Switch 2 controller, just buy this $20 adapter instead, and use it to connect a wireless controller you already own.\nThis adapter goes into the Switch 2’s dock (or directly into the console, if you have a USB-A to C adapter). Connecting your controller is as easy as putting it into pairing mode, then ensuring that the “Pro Controller Wired Communication” option is turned on within the console’s settings. Click and hold the adapter’s coin-shaped button to initiate pairing, then you should be good to go. The DualSense’s rumble and motion controls work seamlessly, and you can remap buttons as you please within the console’s OS, just like you would an official Switch controller.\nBest adapter: 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2\nThe 8BitDo’s latest adapter resembles a flash drive, but once connected to your Switch’s dock, it allows you to wirelessly pair it with a variety of PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo controllers.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $19.99 $16.99 at Amazon\n $19.99 $17.99 at 8BitDo\n $19.99 $16.99 at Best Buy\n\nBest Switch 2 cases\nDbrand Killswitch\nThe Killswitch is a great Switch 2 companion, whether you’re someone who primarily uses the console in handheld mode or while it’s docked. It’s a case that wraps around the Switch 2’s back, with detachable components that snugly grip onto each Joy-Con 2, adding some extra bulk that makes them more comfortable to hold. Above all else, it’s a great way to protect your console from scratches and slightly more significant damage. What’s also great is that it doesn’t limit its flexibility as a hybrid console.\nEach Killswitch ships with a USB-C dock adapter that is inserted into the Switch 2 dock. Since the case-equipped console can no longer fit in Nintendo’s dock, this adapter lets you connect it to your TV without taking off the case. It’s tougher to correctly align the Switch 2’s USB-C jack with this adapter than it is to put it in the dock, but it gets easier with practice. \nRead our review of the Dbrand Killswitch\nDbrand Killswitch – Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 at Dbrand\n\nTomtoc FancyCase Slim zip-up case\nThe best, slimmest zip-up case you should buy is made by Tomtoc. Compared to the Belkin hard zip-up case that I got my hands on before the Switch 2’s launch, the Tomtoc FancyCase slim case feels more durable; anecdotally, it holds up much better to being squeezed by hand. It even has more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2 sticks, so it’ll never press them in on accident. Like most zip-up cases, it features a screen cover that doubles as cartridge storage. This one can hold 12 cartridges.\nI’m confident that it’ll absorb more potential damage over time than other cases I’ve tried. Plus, it just looks cooler, with low-profile designs for gamers who don’t want to draw attention to their console. That said, its “Froz Edition” has ice cream-inspired looks that are a lot more expressive.\ntomtoc slim carrying case for the Switch 2\nThis hard case has a soft touch and a slim fit, and includes a flap that can hold up to 12 cartridges as it protects the console’s screen.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $47.99 $30.99 at Amazon\n\nBelkin fabric zip-up case\nBelkin’s $29.99 zip-up case is another competent, good-looking option that’s slim and lightweight. It’s worth considering over the Tomtoc for one reason only: its built-in pocket, which is great if you need to stow a charging cable or any other small doo-dads. Not to mention, this pocket contains another pocket for an AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, so you can track this case’s location should you lose track of it.\nBelkin makes a thicker, pricier version of this case that has a 20,000mAh 20W battery inside. It’s nearly identical until you open it. A cutout fits this (and only this) Belkin battery perfectly, and it lets you charge your Switch 2 at top speeds while it’s protected.\nBelkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 at Amazon\n $29.99 at Belkin\n\nBest Switch 2 cameras\nThe best webcam that you can get for your Switch 2 should be the cheapest one you can find that’s guaranteed to work with it. So far, Logitech has confirmed that almost all of its webcams support the Switch 2, and Elgato has updated its Facecam MK.2 to support it, as well. Elgato’s model is pricier than we recommend most people spend, but it’s a solid option if you also have a PC to use it with. It’s worth knowing that the Switch 2 displays low-fidelity video feeds during gameplay, so unless you plan to use the webcam with your PC as well, it’s not worth spending a lot for a model that promises great video quality. \nLogitech Brio 100 webcam\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $39.99 $37.3 at Amazon\n $39.99 $29.99 at Staples\n $39.99 at Logitech\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Camera\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $54 at Walmart\n $54.99 at Best Buy\n $54.99 at Target\n\nElgato Facecam MK.2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $139.99 $118.99 at Best Buy\n $139.99 $118.99 at Amazon\n $139.99 $119.99 at B&H Photo\n\nBest Switch 2 portable batteries\nThe Switch 2 is more powerful than the original Switch. However, it doesn’t require all that much more power to charge, even while you’re playing games. While new phones and tablets are breaking new ground with fast charging speeds, getting a power bank that can deliver at least 20W is totally sufficient to get the fastest-possible charging speeds with the Switch 2 in handheld mode. \nBy using a display-equipped USB-C cable with a wattage reading, I was able to see that the Switch 2 usually pulls a maximum of about 15-17W of power (sometimes less) from a USB-C battery during gameplay. When the system was asleep, the rate went down to between 8-13W, fluctuating at different points during the charging process. From a totally dead state, the console took almost 90 minutes to reach 69 percent with a 20W battery plugged into it. You’ll likely drain your USB-C battery more quickly if you’re playing as you charge.\nThankfully, your options for compatible batteries are plentiful. You’ll likely be paying for more power than you’ll need with the Switch 2, but more power (and especially more ports) are never a bad thing to have too much of.\nAnker Zolo Power Bank (10K, 30W)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $25.99 at Amazon\n $25.99 at Anker\n\nUgreen Nexode power bank (20K, 45W)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $45.99 $29.99 at Amazon\n\nBaseus Picogo power bank (10K, 45W)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $39.99 $24.69 at Amazon\n\nIniu Pocket Rocket P50 power bank\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $38.99 $29.99 at Amazon\n\nBest microSD Express cards for Switch 2\nThe Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards of up to 2TB, even though models with that amount of storage aren’t yet available for purchase. Most brands make cards in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB configurations, and some offer 1TB cards as well. I’d suggest grabbing the cheapest microSD Express card you can find, as so far they all offer similarly fast read/write speeds. \nSandisk microSD Express card\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $71.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $119.99 $116.99 at Amazon (512GB)\n $119.99 at Best Buy (512GB)\n\nSamsung microSD Express Card (256GB)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $59.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $59.99 at Target (256GB)\n\nPNY microSD Express card\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $58.99 at B&H Photo (256GB)\n $119.99 at Amazon (512GB)\n\nGameStop microSD Express card\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $54.99 at GameStop (256GB)\n $189.99 at GameStop (1TB)\n\nUpdate, September 5th: This article was updated to reflect changing prices and stock.",

      "raw": "Bose will now let you turn ANC off on its new QuietComfort Ultra headphones, boosting battery life to up to 45 hours. | Image: Bose\t\n\nBose has announced a second-generation version of its QuietComfort Ultra wireless headphones that it introduced nearly two years ago. The name is the same, but the new one finally adds support for listening to lossless audio over a USB-C cable, while still carrying forward the 2.5-millimeter analog headphone jack for those who don’t always want to go wireless.\nThe headphones are available for preorder starting today through Bose’s online store and are priced at $449 — a small bump from the original’s $429. They’re expected to be available starting on October 2nd. They’ll launch in four color options, including black, white smoke, driftwood sand, and midnight violet.\nBattery life has been increased to up to 30 hours with active noise cancellation (ANC), with an improved Aware Mode that’s better at automatically boosting the ANC to filter out sudden loud noises like a passing bus. That will drop to up to 23 hours with head-tracking Immersive Audio turned on, but Bose will now let you push the Ultra’s battery life to up to 45 hours by completely turning ANC off in the mobile app.\nA new Cinema Mode delivers what Bose describes as a “movie-like experience” by spatializing and balancing background sound effects to create a wider sound stage, making dialogue easier to hear. The company recommends using it for podcasts and audiobooks. The new QuietComfort Ultra also feature better bass performance at higher volumes, while background noise generated by the ANC system is reduced in quieter settings and won’t drown out “finer details” in what you’re listening to.\nBose has improved the Ultra’s on-head detection so the headphones will automatically power up and connect to a paired device as soon as you put them on. When removed, laying the headphones flat or folding them into their included carrying case will put them into a low-power standby mode that Bose says will keep them powered for months.\nThe QuietComfort Ultra now support Bluetooth 5.4 and carry forward features like multipoint connectivity and compatibility with the SBC, AAC, and Qualcomm AptX Adaptive codecs. Android users can streamline connectivity with their devices using Google Fast Pair, and Spotify Tap is also supported.",
