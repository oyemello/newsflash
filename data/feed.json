      "raw": "We might have a new king of esports gaming monitors — one with fewer compromises than usual. Asus has just announced the ROG Swift OLED PG27AQWP-W at Gamescom 2025. Not only does it offer a 26.5-inch 2560 x 1440 QHD OLED screen at a blazing-fast 540Hz, it’s also a dual-mode panel that can switch to a practically unheard-of 720Hz refresh rate when you kick the graphics down to 1080p* resolution.\nAsus may not technically have the fastest monitor ever made, as both Koorui and HKC have announced 750Hz 1080p monitors, but both of those have TN panels that won’t even begin to compete on color, brightness, and viewing angles. They’re from brands we don’t typically see in western countries, and neither lets you switch to higher resolution when you don’t need all the speed. \nMeanwhile, the Asus isn’t just OLED — it’s a tandem OLED panel that should dramatically boost HDR brightness and allegedly improve lifespan. It’s also got a glossy coating that could make its colors even more vibrant and its blacks even blacker than OLED tech can already afford, assuming you’re not playing in a room with glare (though Asus claims the coating minimizes glare “even in bright rooms.”)\nHere’s the part where I’d normally say “who needs 540Hz let alone 720Hz? Have you done the math and seen the diminishing returns?” Instead, I’m too busy gaping at Asus’ stunning new silver and translucent plastic design. Clear gadgets are near and dear to my heart, after all, and the skeletal silver really makes it stand out in a sea of black-framed panels. \nUnfortunately, we don’t have pricing or a release date yet, and I suspect it’ll cost a pretty penny because Asus chose that groundbreaking panel and did all that work to set it apart. Seeing more OLED monitor prices come down to earth would excite me even more than a new flagship like this.\nAlso, I would prefer a smaller stand to the huge three-blade propeller, but unfortunately, Asus does make you compromise to get that. The company’s also introducing a new ROG Strix OLED XG27AQWMG today with the same tandem OLED tech, but as you can see in the one-pager below, it’s a 280Hz panel that still relies on either HDMI 2.1 or DisplayPort 1.4’s DSC compression, rather than the flagship’s new DisplayPort 2.1a which boasts 80Gbps of bandwidth.\nBoth have Asus’ “Neo Proximity Sensor,” a relatively new feature it’s been adding to OLED panels, “to accurately measure the user’s distance to the monitor and automatically switch to a black screen when the user is away,” as an extra protection against burn-in. Asus also tends to offer a three-year warranty against OLED burn-in these days, and both LG Display and Samsung Display’s newer panels have many protections against it; as long as those protections aren’t over-aggressive, burn-in is no longer a reason I’d personally steer away.\nJust know that other monitor makers will probably use the same 4th-gen WOLED tandem panel from LG Display, too. SDC has already announced one, and other brands might follow suit.\n*If you’ve heard of 720Hz before, it’s probably because LG Display already announced the dual-mode 720Hz panel that appears in this monitor. And if you’re wondering why we say 1080p rather than 720p as others are reporting, it’s because we fact-checked with both Asus and LG Display that the panel is 1080p at 720Hz. We’ll let you know if we hear different.",

Key Investment Group, which also does business as Epic Seats, TotalTickets.com, and Totally Tix, is accused of violating the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act by using virtual and traditional credit card numbers, along with spoofed IP addresses, fake accounts it paid real people to make, and banks of SIM cards used to receive verification texts to numbers it controlled,  to get around security protections.\nKey Investment Group then allegedly resold these tickets on secondary ticket-selling sites and Ticketmaster’s resale platform to people who couldn’t beat its alleged army of accounts to buy them directly. The FTC’s lawsuit is part of a broader clampdown on live event ticket sellers in the US.\nIn the lawsuit filed on Monday, the FTC claims Key Investment Group bought $57 million worth of tickets from Ticketmaster in just over one year, while reselling them at a “significant markup” for $64 million. The reseller allegedly purchased 2,280 of Swift’s Eras Tour tickets from March to August 2023 for nearly $745,000 and resold them for around $1.9 million. During this time, the FTC claims Key Investment Group used 49 accounts to buy 273 tickets to Taylor Swift’s March 25th concert at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas in 2023, “dramatically exceeding” the six-ticket limit.\nKey Investment Group refutes the lawsuit in a statement released on Monday, saying the FTC has “twisted the intent” of the BOTS Act and is using it as a “weapon” targeting business and consumers. “Under the FTC’s interpretation, anyone who purchases more than four tickets or uses more than one account could be deemed in violation of federal law,” Key Investment Group claims. “The FTC misleadingly characterizes KIG’s [Key Investment Group] use of standard internet browsers to purchase tickets as equivalent to deploying unlawful software.”",

The game already features multiple head-to-head modes when two Chromatic handhelds are connected using an optional Link Cable, but the new Battle Mode is the first time that players can interact with each other.\nWhen one player clears lines and reduces their Tetris stack, their opponent’s stack grows even taller with “garbage lines” added to the bottom featuring random spaces that make them harder to clear. It was a gameplay mode included with the version of Tetris that shipped with the original Nintendo Game Boy, and some gamers have wondered why it wasn’t in ModRetro’s version already.\nThe free update is available today to every Chromatic owner, who will be able to upgrade their Tetris cartridges using the handheld’s Cart Clinic feature while it’s connected to a PC or Mac. Because it’s the cartridge itself being updated, and not the Chromatic, the new Battle Mode will also be available when using the game in other devices, like an original Game Boy Color.",

A release window announcement and subsequent delay didn’t help things. But Nintendo shared proof-of-life for Silksong earlier this year when it snuck a vague “2025” release date into its big Switch 2 Direct presentation.\nAnd as of late, there have been a lot of hints that some big Silksong news is imminent: the game will be shown at both Nintendo and Xbox’s Gamescom booths this week, and on Monday, Gamescom Opening Night Live host Geoff Keighley tweeted a picture of himself wearing a clown nose. However, the game’s release date won’t be announced during Tuesday’s Opening Night Live show, according to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier.\nI’m unrealistically hoping that Silksong releases on Thursday. I’m on vacation next week, which would give me a perfect excuse to dive into the game. But if the release date is a little bit after, no biggie — maybe I’ll get lost in the original Hollow Knight one more time.",

      "raw": "Google itself shared this image of a Pixel 10 phone, most likely the 10 Pro.\t\n\nGoogle is gearing up to launch a new slate of Pixel devices at its Made by Google event this week, led by the flagship Pixel 10 phone line, with updated watches and earbuds expected to arrive, too.\nThis year’s Pixel line has been leaked extensively over the past few weeks, revealing just about everything we think the company will announce at tomorrow’s launch event, right down to colors, specs, and prices.\nThe company has even officially confirmed a few things about the devices and the August 20th event. Our latest look comes from an ad that gives us glimpses of most of the new hardware, along with the promise of guest stars including Jimmy Fallon, Steph Curry, Lando Norris, and the Jonas Brothers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour Pixel 10 phones\nIt’s no secret that the Pixel 10 line is coming, as Google has already shown off the phones. We’re expecting four models this year: the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.\nYou can see the 10, one of the Pro models, and the Fold all appear briefly in the ad embedded above, and Google has also released separate teasers focusing on the designs of the Pro and the Pro Fold, both of which are seen in a grayish blue color we’re expecting to be called “moonstone.” That bright blue Pixel 10 in the event ad is apparently a color that Google is calling “indigo,” and the whole lineup appears in this leaked image obtained by Android Authority:\nIf you want the full deep dive on the four new phones, I’ve been tracking every major Pixel 10 announcement, leak, and rumor, but I’ll stick to the highlights here.\nFirst, it seems likely that the base Pixel 10 will jump to a triple camera setup for the first time, with a new 5x telephoto lens. The downside is that we’re expecting downgrades to the main and ultrawide cameras to compensate, which may even make the 10’s main camera worse than the Pixel 9’s. Not everyone will see that as an overall upgrade.\nThe big change across all four phones should be the introduction of Qi2 magnetic wireless charging, which we’re hoping will also include adoption of the faster Qi 25W standard announced last month. Leakers claim that Google will also be releasing a line of magnetic accessories to go with the phone, using “Pixelsnap” branding for its alternative to MagSafe.\nMeanwhile, the 10 Pro Fold is rumored to be the first foldable from any manufacturer to come with an IP68 rating, indicating total protection from dust and small particles, in addition to strong water resistance. If true, that sounds like a bit of an engineering coup for Google, and we’ll be curious to hear more about how it was done.\nWe also know a lot about the Pixel’s upcoming software upgrades. Google has already shown off Material 3 Expressive, the colorful new design language arriving in Android 16’s first quarterly update, likely alongside the new Pixel 10 phones. It could also bring a new Android desktop mode with it, which we hope to hear more about tomorrow, and we’ll be pretty shocked if there aren’t some extra AI announcements to come, too.\nFinally, it sounds like we can expect the Pixel 10 phones to stay at the same prices as their Pixel 9 counterparts, at least in the US, with starting prices ranging from $799 for the Pixel 10 up to $1,799 for the 10 Pro Fold. The only exception is the 10 Pro XL, which might jump $100 to a $1,199 start price, but if so, it would be by ditching the previous 128GB model and starting at 256GB of storage instead.\nPixel Watch 4\nNew flagship Pixel phones mean a new flagship Pixel Watch, and this year is no exception. As with the Pixel Watch 3, we’re expecting to see two different sizes of the Pixel Watch 4, 41mm and 45mm, launching in colors that will mostly match the new phone lines.\nWe’ve only heard about one really huge change to the Watch 4, and it’s an unexpected one: an entirely new charger. This year’s watches will apparently charge on their sides, which might mean both faster charging and a new nightstand-ready charging UI. There’s even been a report that the change makes the watch easier to repair, though how much easier is still unknown. \nOn the software side, we’re not sure what’s coming to the Watch 4, since Google has already released its big Gemini update for Pixel watches. It should also get a Material 3 Expressive update to the aesthetic, and we’d be fools to bet against more AI announcements.\nLike the phones, we’ve heard the Pixel Watch 4 will stay at the same price as its predecessor: from $349 for a Wi-Fi model and $399 for LTE.\nPixel Buds 2A\nLast and — let’s be fair — maybe least exciting, Google should be bringing a new pair of budget earbuds, the Pixel Buds 2A.\nIt’s been four whole years since the launch of the $99 Pixel Buds A-Series, so these are long overdue. Still, we don’t know a whole lot about what to expect, beyond a few leaked images of a design that takes after the Pixel Buds Pro 2.\nOur best guesses come from the reliable leaker Evan Blass, who recently shared a spec sheet indicating that the Buds 2A will get significant sound upgrades to include both active noise cancellation and spatial audio, though without either the Silent Seal 2.0 tech or head tracking found in the Pro 2 versions of those features. Battery life should also lag a little behind the Pro 2, at seven hours on the buds and 20 including the case.\nWe haven’t yet seen any solid reports about the Buds 2A’s price in the US, but WinFuture reports a European price of €149 (about $175), up from €99 on the previous generation. That suggests a US price of around $149 is likely.\nIt’s also worth noting that we’ve seen the Pixel Buds Pro 2 appear in the new moonstone color that’s launching with the Pro phones, suggesting some update to that product, but we’re not sure if there’ll be anything announced beyond a new color.\nStaggered sales\nFinally, while Google may be announcing all this hardware at the same time, that doesn’t mean it’ll be selling them together.\nIt’s been reported that only the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL will be going on sale this month, on August 28th. The 10 Pro XL, Watch 4, and Buds 2A will apparently be delayed and won’t actually hit shelves until October 9th, which is almost two months from now.",

      "raw": "Apple’s latest MacBook Air is one of the best laptops on sale. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\t\n\nIf you want a great laptop, you’re going to have to fork over a ton of money, right? Not necessarily. There are dozens of good laptops on the market at various price points. However, it can feel overwhelming to find the right one for your needs (some are better suited for, say, college students, whereas others are ideal for gamers).\nThat’s why we’ve come up with this list of some of the best laptop deals available right now. In addition to the latest discounts, we’ll share each discounted model’s best features (and downsides) to give you more clarity during your shopping journey. And if you need to do more research, you can also check out our guides to the best laptops on the market and the top gaming laptops.\nThe best laptop deals\nApple MacBook deals\nM1 MacBook Air\n2020 MacBook Air with M1 (256GB)\nThe 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold).\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $649 $599 at Walmart\n\nApple itself no longer sells the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1 — and hasn’t for years — but you can still get this solid laptop for $599.99 ($50 off) at Walmart. The 2020 model is available in one configuration, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but it’s still capable at handling basic tasks like a champ, including streaming video, browsing, and dealing with documents. You can also use the M1 MacBook Air for creative work in Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Logic, and Pixelmator, though you may experience slowdown due to its low 8GB of memory.\nThe laptop’s battery lasted between eight and ten hours when we originally reviewed it, and those figures should be mostly accurate, barring some differences likely caused by operating system updates. In addition to offering great performance for its price, the laptop also comes with other nice-to-have features, including a comfortable keyboard and an excellent trackpad. Just note its 720p webcam isn’t particularly good, so if a high-resolution webcam matters a lot to you, you may want to buy one separately. Also, be aware that, due to the limitations of the M1 chip, you can only use one external display at a time and port selection is also more limited than newer models.\nM2 MacBook Air\n13-inch MacBook Air with M2 (2022)\nThe 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $699 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n\nApple’s 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip is a significant leap above the M1 model it succeeded, both in terms of design and performance. The old wedge-shaped look was replaced for a more squared-off design that’s still used by the current-generation MacBook Air. It has a 1080p webcam, which was a welcome improvement given the disappointing camera on the 2020 M1 model. It’s also much lighter and thus more portable as well, yet it retains features like MagSafe charging and Touch ID, as well as a nice display.\nDespite its age, the M2 processor inside of this machine is still powerful enough to handle many tasks, from common ones such as browsing to more complex and creative projects. Compared to newer, pricier models, this one unsurprisingly struggles with gaming. That being said, it’s capable of running Cyberpunk 2077. The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 launched with 8GB of RAM, but that configuration became unavailable last year when Apple made 16GB the new standard. \nWhile a well-rounded laptop overall, there is one key area where Apple’s M1 model is better: storage. The base M2 MacBook Air with 256GB of storage is actually slower than its predecessor because it’s stored in a single NAND chip. This was corrected in subsequent MacBook Air models, so the slowdown is unique to M2 machines with 256GB of storage. Also, be aware as well that port selection isn’t great, and the included display notch — which is also found on both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros — can make using the menu bar more challenging until you get used to it. If that doesn’t bother you, however, you can get a configuration with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, an 8-core CPU and GPU for $699 ($100 off) at Best Buy. \nM4 MacBook Air\nApple MacBook Air 13 (2025, M4)\nThe M4 MacBook Air has a speedy processor, and double the RAM of previous models. It has a thin and light design, all day battery life, and still starts with 256GB of storage.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 $799 at Amazon\n $999 $799 at Best Buy\n\nThe 13-inch MacBook Air with M4 is Apple’s latest thin and lightweight laptop, and it’s our top pick in The Verge’s guide to the best laptops right now. It’s not a MacBook Pro, but Apple’s M4 processor in the Air is still mighty capable. In our tests, it only throttled under heavy load from creative applications, which is understandable given its fanless design. The machine comes with 16GB of RAM as standard rather than an optional upgrade, but the base configuration still comes with just 256GB of storage, so be mindful of that limitation if you work with a lot of larger files. \nApple hasn’t increased the number of ports on a MacBook Air since reintroducing MagSafe to the M2 model in 2022, but this generation has Thunderbolt 4 ports rather than Thunderbolt 3 for faster file transfer speeds. Another notable addition is the 1080p Center Stage camera from the MacBook Pro, so you’ll stay in frame if you move around on a video call. Battery life should last all day, though your experience will vary depending on how hard you push this machine. \nYou can currently get a configuration of the 13-inch with M4 with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and a 10-core CPU and GPU for $799 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. If you need a larger screen, you can get the 15-inch MacBook Air with the same specs for $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4\nThe entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — and a 512GB SSD for the same starting price of $1,599. It also gets a third USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port and comes in a new space black option.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1299 at Best Buy\n $1599 $1299 at Amazon\n $1599 $1399 at B&H Photo\n\n\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro\nThe 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 12-core / 16-core M4 Pro chip starts with 24GB of RAM — a 6GB increase over the prior generation. It also has a 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, an optional nano-texture display, and a 12-megapixel webcam.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $1699 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $1699 at B&H Photo (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1999 $1699 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\n\n16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM and offers more computing cores (14 for the CPU and 20 for the GPU) compared to the 14-inch model. It also picks up Thunderbolt 5 ports and a new 12-megapixel Center Stage camera.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $2223 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $2249 at B&H Photo (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nThe M4 generation MacBook Pros are Apple’s fastest laptops yet. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, and comes equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a MagSafe charging port. It can send video to two external displays simultaneously (the previous generation could only handle one) and has an improved 12-megapixel Center Stage camera with better video quality. \nThe M4 MacBook Pro and M4 MacBook Air run on the same chip, but the Pro’s cooling system is better, so it handles resource-intensive tasks (including games) without throttling as easily. The laptop’s 14.2-inch screen is bright (up to 1,600 nits when viewing HDR content), and supports the P3 color gamut, both of which are important to professionals who rely on color accuracy when editing photos and video. The display has a 120Hz refresh rate, so scrolling through webpages or moving windows around should appear smoother than 60Hz screens. In our stress test, which included editing 33-megapixel RAW images and working with a large photo library in Adobe Lightroom, the laptop ran for 12 hours without kicking up the fans or feeling hot to the touch. \nIf you want even more power, you can jump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro processor. It comes with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, a 12-core CPU, and a 16-core GPU. The M4 Pro MacBook Pro has over twice the memory bandwidth of the base M4 MacBook Pro, so it should perform better across the board. That said, it might be tough to notice the benefits of its extra memory and processing power during casual use, but it will come in handy when you’re pushing the laptop to the limits while video editing or playing games. It has three Thunderbolt 5 ports, and you can use that extra bandwidth with an external SSD with fast transfer speeds, to name an example. You can also get the MacBook Pro with M4 Pro with a 16-inch screen if you’d like to work on a larger display. \nRight now, the 14-inch M4 model with 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD and 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU is $1,299 ($300 off) at Best Buy and $200 off at B&H Photo. You can get a 14-inch M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 12-core CPU, and 16-core GPU for around $1,699 at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The 16-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 14-core CPU, and 20-core GPU is currently on sale for around $2,223 at Amazon and B&H Photo. \nMicrosoft Surface deals\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition\nThe 13.8-inch Surface Laptop is Microsoft’s closest rival to the MacBook Air, using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chipsets for exceptional battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $999.99 at Amazon (X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1399.99 $1099.99 at Best Buy (X Elite, 16GB RAM, 512 SSD)\n\nWe chose Microsoft’s 7th Edition Surface Laptop as one of the best laptops you can get because it’s the top Snapdragon Copilot Plus PC we’ve tried yet. The laptop runs on a power-efficient ARM processor that doesn’t skimp on performance. Its 13.8-inch 2,304 x 1,536 120Hz screen supports Dolby Vision HDR (High Dynamic Range) and looks very nice. It has a large, precision haptic trackpad that gives you plenty of room to tap and swipe, an offers satisfying feedback no matter where you press it. \nThe laptop has a pair of USB 4 ports, one USB-A 3.1 Gen 1 port, plus a headphone jack. One of the concerns of using an ARM-based Windows PC has been software compatibility, but this model proves that’s no longer something to be as worried about. It runs Photoshop, and apps compiled for X86 processors work thanks to Microsoft’s Prism emulator. Be sure to check the compatibility of the specific Windows app you rely, though, as there’s still a chance they won’t work as intended. \nEven after our toughest tests, the battery lasted seven hours. That’s with 100 percent screen brightness, after downloading multiple Steam games, attending video calls, and running through multiple projects in Photoshop. Using the laptop with less power-hungry apps, including Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, and Chrome, the laptop used just 30 percent of its battery in seven hours. For the best battery life, you’ll want to stick to using native ARM apps when possible. If you want to make the switch to an ARM-based laptop to get some of the benefits MacBook users have had for years, the 7th Generation Surface Laptop is worth checking out.\nYou can get a 13.8-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop (7th Edition) with a Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD for $999 ($100 off) at Amazon. A model with the Snapdragon X Elite processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is on sale for $1,099.99 ($300 off) at Best Buy.\nAsus laptop deals\nAsus Zenbook S 16\nAsus Zenbook S 16\nThe Asus Zenbook S 16 features AMD’s Ryzen AI mobile processors. It’s one of the thinnest and lightest 16-inch laptops available and doesn’t cut corners on performance. It’s a mighty machine that can handle all sorts of heavy workloads with ease and grace.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $1399.99 at Asus\n\nWe chose Asus’ Zenbook S 16 as another one of our top recommendations for students, but it’s a solid laptop for anyone who wants a large-screened Windows laptop. In our tests, the 16-inch 120Hz 3K (2,880 x 1,800) OLED display emits vivid colors and excellent contrast. The laptop was more than capable of handling common tasks, including video chats using its 1080p webcam, music streaming, but its graphics and gaming performance is what really sets it apart from laptops in its size and price classes. \nThis machine runs Cyberpunk 2077 at around 77 frames per second with the resolution set to 1080p with AMD’s FSR 2.1 upscaling software turned on. The laptop isn’t designed for gaming, but it’s good to know it’s up to the task if you’re willing to turn down some graphical settings. The Zenbook S 16’s battery lasted 11 hours during our testing. However, the percentage indicator in the Windows taskbar would often fluctuate, making it difficult to pin down exactly how much juice was left. \nYou can get a configuration of the laptop with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor for $1,399.99 ($400 off) from Asus.\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2025)\nThe latest Zephyrus G14 is a gaming laptop that moonlights as a great general-purpose PC for students. It has a high-resolution OLED display, a larger trackpad than its predecessor, and ample storage, memory, and processing power. These specs are necessary for playing games, but they also ensure the laptop is well suited for resource-intensive tasks, such as 4K video editing and audio production.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $1349.99 at Best Buy\n\nAsus’ Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop we’ve tested recently because of its mix of power and portability. It has a 14-inch 120Hz OLED display with a 2880 x 1800 resolution. It retains the design Asus introduced last year, but received some nice spec bumps. The entry-level model comes with 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, an AMD Ryzen 9 270 processor, and an Nvidia RTX 5060 chip with 8GB of video RAM. The G14 can be specced up with a faster processor, more storage, additional memory, and an Nvidia RTX 5080 if you want a little more oomph. \nThe G14 has a comfortable backlit keyboard with bigger keycaps, a large trackpad, and you can charge the laptop via a USB-C port on either side. You’ll still need to use Asus’ proprietary charger to get the fastest charging speed. We chose it as the best 14-inch gaming laptop because we could play new games on high settings, though doing so would kick up the fan and make the laptop feel warm. When it gets hot, the Zephyrus G14 throttles the GPU to avoid overheating, which will reduce its gaming performance.\nThe laptop weighs 3.31 pounds, a little over half a pound more than the MacBook Air with M4, which proves you don’t have to carry around a massive machine to play games on the go. The Zephyrus G14 has an HDMI 2.1 port to connect it to a 4K 120Hz monitor (we recommend Alienware’s AW2725Q, which is also on sale) or TV. Right now, you can get the entry-level Asus Zephyrus G14 on sale for $1,349.99 ($350 off) at Best Buy.\nAsus ROG Strix Scar 16 (2025, RTX 5080)\nAsus ROG Strix Scar 16 (2025, RTX 5080)\nAsus’ ROG Strix Scar 16 is a powerful gaming laptop configured with a 16-inch 2.5K 240Hz screen, Nvidia 5080 graphics card, Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $3299.99 $2899 at Walmart\n $3299.99 $2999.99 at Best Buy\n $3299.99 $2999.99 at Amazon\n\nIf you want to take a powerful gaming PC with you on the go, Asus’ ROG Strix Scar 16 is one of the best we recommend. It has a 16-inch 240Hz Mini LED display with a resolution of 2,560 x 1,600. The screen can’t quite match an OLED when it comes to rich contrast, but you get Dolby Vision HDR here, and its color accuracy impressed us in our tests. The laptop has larger keys instead of a number pad, which makes sense for a gaming-focused laptop. If you need a number pad, you can bring up a touch-sensitive one by clicking and holding the top part of the laptop’s large trackpad. \nUnder the hood, Asus fitted the ROG Strix Scar 16 with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32GB of RAM, 2TB of storage, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card with 16GB of dedicated video memory. The laptop’s display supports Nvidia’s G-Sync technology, so you shouldn’t see screen tearing or other graphical anomalies when playing games. The laptop has three USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, an ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. You can use either the HDMI 2.1 port or Thunderbolt 5 ports to carry a 4K 120Hz video signal to a compatible TV or gaming monitor. \nIn case aesthetics matter to you, the ROG Strix Scar 16 has RGB lighting on its underside as well as a dot-matrix LED array that can display animations on its lid. These features aren’t new, but each can add some flair to your setup. Right now, you can get the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 in its base configuration for around $2,899.99 ($400 off) at Walmart and $2,999.99 ($300 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.\nUpdate, August 19th: Updated pricing and availability, and added a deal for ASUS’ ROG Zephyrus G14 (2025).",

So if anyone tries to eat you, they’ll be exposed to something called a cardiotonic steroid — and may die of a heart attack. Well, unfortunately, for you, some animals have developed adaptations to these toxic steroids. Evolutionary biologist Shabnam Mohammadi has spent her career studying how these adaptations work — and says even humans have used these toxins to their advantage since ancient Egypt. So today on Short Wave, we get a little… toxic (cue Brittney Spears). Host Regina G. Barber talks to Shabnam about how some predators can get away with eating toxic prey. \n\nCurious about biology?
