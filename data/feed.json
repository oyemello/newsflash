      "raw": "The iPhone Air starts at $999. | Image: The Verge\t\n\nApple’s iPhone 17, the 17 Pro, the 17 Pro Max, and the thin iPhone Air are now available in stores and online.\nBeyond the Air’s shockingly slim design, Apple’s latest iPhone lineup features a number of notable updates worth upgrading for, especially if you have a phone that’s a few generations old. The standard iPhone 17 — which is a shockingly good value, by the way — now features a larger 6.3-inch display with ProMotion and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Meanwhile, the Pro model has returned to an aluminum build while adding the biggest battery of any iPhone yet. The iPhone Air and Pro models have a lot in common, including having a raised “plateau” bump on the back, which contains not just cameras but some internal components, too, leaving some extra room in the phones for larger batteries.\nThe iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and Air start at $799, $1,099, $1,199, and $999, respectively, and each model starts with 256GB of storage. Below, you’ll find more information about each new device, along with where you can pick them up.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere to buy the iPhone Air\nWhere to buy the iPhone 17\nWhere to buy the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max\nUS carrier deals and incentives\n\nWhere to buy the iPhone Air\nThe iPhone Air finally made its debut after months of rumors. It’s Apple’s thinnest iPhone ever at 5.6mm thick, and it features a 6.5-inch ProMotion display and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Apple says the design is its “most durable” yet, with a ceramic shield that encloses a titanium frame on both sides (also found in the iPhone 17 Pro). The device also sports a single 48-megapixel fusion camera on the back, an 18-megapixel Center Stage selfie cam on its front, along with an A19 Pro processor and Apple’s in-house C1X modem. Despite its thinner design, Apple says the Air features “all-day battery life,” with up to 27 hours of video playback, or 40 hours when the $99 iPhone Air MagSafe battery is attached.\nThe iPhone Air is available at Apple, Best Buy, and Walmart starting at $999 for 256GB of storage and going up to $1,399 for the 1TB model.\niPhone Air\nThe iPhone Air is Apple’s thinnest iPhone yet at 5.6mm, featuring a 6.5-inch ProMotion display, a 48MP fusion camera, and an 18MP front camera with Center Stage support. But its single rear camera and “meh” battery life mean it’s not for everyone.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 at Apple (256GB)\n $999.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $1199 at Apple (512GB)\n\nWhere to buy the iPhone 17\nThe iPhone 17 is Apple’s latest entry-level smartphone, and it’s the one to get this year. Notably, it includes a larger 6.3-inch 120Hz ProMotion display — ripped straight from the iPhone 17 Pro. The device also features a new A19 processor, and a dual 48-megapixel fusion camera system that has a main camera and an ultrawide camera. A new 18-megapixel Center Stage front camera features a square sensor, allowing users to take high-quality landscape-mode selfies without having to rotate their phone.\nThe phone is available in five colors (black, lavender, mist blue, sage, and white) and features a starting storage of 256GB. The iPhone 17 is now available at Apple, Best Buy, and Walmart starting at $799.\niPhone 17\nThe standard iPhone 17 has a 6.3-inch ProMotion display that can reach 3,000 nits of peak brightness, an A19 chip, and a 48MP dual camera system. It also features an 18MP Center Stage selfie camera with a square sensor, allowing users to take landscape selfies while holding the device vertically. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 at Apple (256GB)\n $829.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $999 at Apple (512GB)\n\nWhere to buy the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max look different than previous Pro models. While they keep the same 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays, respectively, Apple has made a few tweaks to the design. One of the first things you’ll probably notice is the plateau camera bump on the back, which houses a trio of 48-megapixel fusion cameras. Both devices also boast an upgraded 18-megapixel selfie camera with support for Center Stage, and a more powerful A19 Pro processor inside. The Pro models feature larger batteries than before, too, with the 17 Pro Max delivering the best battery life ever in an iPhone, according to Apple.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are now available alongside Apple’s other models. The smaller Pro starts at $1,099 for 256GB of storage, while the 17 Pro Max starts at $1,199 for 256GB of storage. For the first time ever, Apple is offering a 2TB configuration of the 17 Pro Max for $1,999. You can nab the 17 Pro from Apple, Best Buy, and Walmart; the 17 Pro Max is also available at Apple, Best Buy, and Walmart.\niPhone 17 Pro\nThe iPhone 17 Pro features a 6.3-inch OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, and it’s powered by an A19 Pro chip. It features a 48MP triple camera system, plus a new “plateau” bar on the back, which Apple says creates additional space for internal components, including a larger battery.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1099 at Apple (256GB)\n $1099.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $1299 at Apple (512GB)\n\n\niPhone 17 Pro Max\nThe larger iPhone 17 Pro Max sports a 6.9-inch OLED screen and the best battery life ever in an iPhone. It has most of the same features as the smaller iPhone 17 Pro, though, but offers storage up to 2TB — a first in the iPhone line.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199 at Apple (256GB)\n $1199.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $1399 at Apple (512GB)\n\nUS carrier deals and incentives\nRather than pay all at once for your phone of choice, several US carriers are offering deals if you purchase or upgrade through them. Just keep in mind that taking advantage of a carrier deal will lock your phone to that network for a period of time, and likely mean you’ll break up the total price into payments that may increase your monthly bill.\nVerizon is offering new and existing customers who trade-in an eligible device up to $1,099 toward an iPhone 17 Pro with a new or upgraded smartphone line on an Unlimited Ultimate plan (minimum $90 per month with autopay, plus taxes and fees for 36 months); the trade-in / promo credit is applied over 36 months. Meanwhile, Verizon is offering new and existing customers who trade in an eligible device up to $1,100 off the iPhone 17 Pro Max with a new or upgraded smartphone line on an Unlimited Ultimate plan, with the trade-in / promo credit applied over 36 months. For upgrades, phones that are traded in must be active on an account for 60 days prior to purchasing a new device.\nT-Mobile is offering up to $1,100 off any 2025 iPhone in 24 monthly bill credits with an eligible trade-in and qualifying service ($100+ per month with auto pay, plus taxes and fees). Meanwhile, you can get up to $830 (no trade-in required) via 24 monthly bill credits when you switch to T-Mobile and add a line on one of its Experience plans.\nAT&T is offering new and existing customers up to $1,100 off an iPhone 17 Pro or 17 Pro Max, and up to $830 off an iPhone 17 or iPhone Air, with the credit being applied over 36 months. The offer is available for new and existing customers with an eligible trade-in in any condition, and activation of a new line or an upgrade of an existing line. For new customers, AT&T says the offer requires a postpaid unlimited voice and data plan starting at $75.99 before the discounts.\nUpdate, September 19th: Updated to note the new 2025 iPhone models are now available in stores and online.",

      "raw": "Security researchers employed ChatGPT as a co-conspirator to plunder sensitive data from Gmail inboxes without alerting users. The vulnerability exploited has been closed by OpenAI but it’s a good example of the new risks inherent to agentic AI.\nThe heist, called Shadow Leak and published by security firm Radware this week, relied on a quirk in how AI agents work. AI Agents are assistants that can act on your behalf without constant oversight, meaning they can surf the web and click on links. AI companies laud them as a massive timesaver after users authorize their access to personal emails, calendars, work documents, etc.\nRadware researchers exploited this helpfulness with a form of attack called a prompt injection, instructions that effectively get the agent to work for the attacker. The powerful tools are impossible to prevent without prior knowledge of a working exploit and hackers have already deployed them in creative ways including rigging peer review, executing scams, and controlling a smart home. Users are often entirely unaware something has gone wrong as instructions can be hidden in plain sight (to humans), for example as white text on a white background. \nThe double agent in this case was OpenAI’s Deep Research, an AI tool embedded within ChatGPT that launched earlier this year. Radware researchers planted a prompt injection in an email sent to a Gmail inbox the agent had access to. There it waited. \nWhen the user next tries to use Deep Research, they would unwittingly spring the trap. The agent would encounter the hidden instructions, which tasked it with searching for HR emails and personal details and smuggling these out to the hackers. The victim is still none the wiser.\nGetting an agent to go rogue — as well as managing to successfully get data out undetected, which companies can take steps to prevent — is no easy task and there was a lot of trial and error. “This process was a rollercoaster of failed attempts, frustrating roadblocks, and, finally, a breakthrough,” the researchers said. \nUnlike most prompt injections, the researchers said Shadow Leak executed on OpenAI’s cloud infrastructure and leaked data directly from there. This makes it invisible to standard cyber defenses, they wrote. \nRadware said the study was a proof-of-concept and warned that other apps connected to Deep Research — including Outlook, GitHub, Google Drive, and Dropbox — may be vulnerable to similar attacks. “The same technique can be applied to these additional connectors to exfiltrate highly sensitive business data such as contracts, meeting notes or customer records,” they said.\nOpenAI has now plugged the vulnerability flagged by Radware in June, the researchers said.",

      "raw": "Well that was awkward.\t\n\nMeta ran into some spectacularly embarrassing technical issues during the live demos of its new smart glasses this week, and now we know why. Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, explained in an Instagram AMA why two notable demos — an influencer asking the AI assistant for cooking instructions, and Mark Zuckerberg attempting to pick up a WhatsApp call — failed. \n“When the chef said ‘hey Meta, start Live AI,’ it started every single Meta Ray-Ban’s Live AI in the building,” said Bosworth. “We had routed Live AI traffic to our dev server, in theory, to isolate it, but we had done it for everyone in that building on those access points. We DDoS’d ourselves, basically.” So yeah, it wasn’t the Wi-Fi, as Zuck claimed on stage.\n\n \n @verge \nSome of the most impressive smart glasses in the industry were presented at Meta Connect 2025, but presenters had some of the biggest demo failures we’ve seen live in a while. In addition, part of the keynote included a sit down discussion with James Cameron and ended with a run into the horizon with Diplo. It was a weird evening. #metaconnect #meta #markzuckerberg #tech #techtok \n ♬ original sound – The Verge \n  \n\n\nThe video call issue was “more obscure,” according to Bosworth, and involved a “never-before-seen bug” that occurred because the Display glasses had gone to sleep at the same moment that the device received the call notification. Bosworth says that the bug has now been fixed, but acknowledged the onstage demo was a “terrible place for that bug to show up.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven with the technical blunders, Meta providing an honest live product demonstration is a nice break from the usual fare of pre-recorded videos and generative AI errors that companies like Apple and Google showcase these days.",

      "raw": "In the future, Intel will make CPUs with Nvidia graphics inside — among other things, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed today that Nvidia will contribute “GPU chiplets” that Intel can place alongside its x86 CPU cores instead of the Arc integrated graphics it develops in-house today.\nBut, at least for now, Intel says that doesn’t mean Intel’s own graphics are going away. “We’re not discussing specific roadmaps at this time, but the collaboration is complementary to Intel’s roadmap and Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings,” Intel told PCWorld, reiterating the commitment that Intel’s Michelle Johnston Holthaus made before she abruptly left the company.\nLike PCWorld, I’m skeptical that Intel will truly push on graphics when Nvidia can do that job, particularly at a time when Intel keeps carving off pieces of itself to save on costs! Why would Intel invest $$$ into catching up with Nvidia (and AMD) when Nvidia’s no longer truly a competitor? Even if it continues, would Intel really give it its utmost? But perhaps there’s time for Intel’s existing efforts to notch another win like the B580, or the surprisingly good followup to MSI’s Claw handheld.\nFor now, we’ll “stay tuned.”",

The two-day shopping affair will grant Prime members access to some of the best prices of the year on Amazon devices, as well as products from Sony, Sonos, Microsoft, Apple, Withings, and other well-known brands. This applies to items spanning a range of categories, including gaming peripherals, laptops, 4K TVs, phones, PC accessories, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a price-tracking tool or deal aggregator\nSet up deal alert notifications through Alexa or the Amazon app\nLook for deals outside of Amazon\nTrust the experts\n\nAs always, you can count on us to publish only the best deals during Prime Big Deal Days — as well as any worthwhile ones featured at Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and other competing retailers. That said, if you want to be sure you catch any and all deals that are most important to you — or be among the first to know of certain price drops — we’ve compiled some helpful tools and advice.\nBelow, we’ve spelled out a few of our best deal-hunting tips, from how to use automated price trackers to the different ways you can set up your own personalized deal alerts. All of these methods and tools are free to use, and once you put in just a little bit of work, you can rest easy knowing that you don’t need to take much action until it comes time to make a purchase.\nUse a price-tracking tool or deal aggregator\nCamelCamelCamel\nCamelCamelCamel tracks the price of every product sold on Amazon and can send you alerts only when they reach the price that’s right for you. Once a product reaches the desired price you’ve set (or goes below it), you’ll get an email about it. CamelCamelCamel only works for products on Amazon, so you’ll need to use one of the other methods below if you want to track price movement at Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and other retailers.\nTo track prices and get alerts via email, you’ll first need to create a free account. We also suggest installing the site’s browser extension, called The Camelizer, which lets you see pricing trends on a product-by-product basis, and allows you to set your desired price without navigating away from Amazon. It’s fantastic and easy to use.\nAnd, if you already have a wishlist saved on Amazon, you can import it into CamelCamelCamel.\nSlickdeals\nSlickdeals aggregates some of the best deals around the internet, as discovered by its team and community of users. It’s a great place to find a curated set of deals on things you might be interested in. The site also allows you to create deal alerts based on keywords, but they work a little differently on Slickdeals than they do on the above sites.\nYou can type in a product name, like “Sonos Era 100” or a retailer’s name, and once it’s added to your list, you’ll be notified of a deal alert if it meets your criteria. You can set it to alert you to any deal related to your keyword, or you can filter out deals so that you’ll be notified if, for example, the deal is popular enough to make it to Slickdeals’ front page or earned a high rating from the community. Setting these keywords a little too broadly may result in frequent notification pings and emails, though, so you’ll need to use some discretion and find the right balance of how aggressively you want Slickdeals to notify you.\nKeepa\nKeepa is another handy tool you can use to track and compare Amazon prices over time. Like CamelCamelCamel, Keepa provides charts that track pricing trends and will alert you when it finds a deal. You can also import any wishlists you’ve previously saved on Amazon.\nUnlike CamelCamelCamel, however, you don’t necessarily need to create an account in order to track prices with Keepa. You just need to install the extension, and Keepa will automatically add a price history graph to supported product listings. The embedded extension features different tabs as well, one of which showcases pricing history and another that allows you to specify various pricing details. Once you’ve set your desired price, you’ll then receive price alerts via email, push notification, or RSS.\nSet up deal alert notifications through Alexa or the Amazon app\nIf you’re a Prime member who owns a fourth-gen Echo speaker or a newer model, you can also request that Amazon send you deal notifications up to 24 hours ahead of time on products you’re interested in. Amazon can alert you of price drops on eligible products in your shopping cart or wishlist, as well as anything you’ve marked as “saved for later.” To enable the feature, tap More > Settings > Notifications in the Alexa app, and then tap Amazon Shopping. Then, scroll down to Shopping Recommendations and enable Deal Recommendations. Once done, you’ll receive a notification on both your device and your Echo speaker (the latter in the form of a yellow ring) notifying you of the deal.\nAlternatively, you can sign up to receive deal alerts regarding products you’ve recently viewed in the Amazon Shopping app, as well as those related to your recent search history. If you’re a Prime member, you just need to navigate to the Prime Day event page in the mobile app between now and July 8th to create an alert. Once done, you’ll receive push notifications for any deal(s) you’ve subscribed to when the event begins. You can also just open the Amazon Shopping app and tap Settings > Notifications > Deals and Recommendations before toggling “Savings” and / or “Recommendations.”\nLook for deals outside of Amazon\nPrime Day is meant to show off Amazon’s huge retail presence, so, naturally, other retail chains take notice. Because of this, you can sometimes find better deals at retailers like Target, Walmart, and Best Buy. At the very least, they may be able to match Amazon’s pricing if you ask.\nIf Amazon’s upcoming sale doesn’t have everything you want or if you just want to make sure you’re getting the best deal, shop around a bit. In the past, Target, Walmart, and Best Buy have hosted their own events in an effort to counter Amazon. And as usual, you’ll be able to find all of our deals coverage in and outside of Amazon here.\nTrust the experts\nWe’re a discerning bunch here at The Verge, so don’t fret if you’re going into this without any prep. We’ll be corralling the best tech deals and keeping our coverage up to date in the run-up to the main event. So mark October 7th on your calendar, sign up for Amazon Prime and our new and improved Verge Deals newsletter, and maybe start putting aside a little spending cash.",

      "raw": "José Muñoz, president and CEO of Hyundai Motor Company, delivers remarks at the company’s CEO Investor Day on September 18th in New York City. | Image: Jason DeCrow / AP Content Services for Hyundai Motor Company\n\t\n\nToday, the CEO of Hyundai sought to distance his company from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid earlier this month at the company’s battery factory in Georgia, which resulted in the arrest of hundreds of South Korean workers. \nThe factory is operated by LG Energy Solutions, and most of the workers that were detained were employed by suppliers for that company, not Hyundai, José Muñoz said in a briefing with reporters on Thursday after the automaker’s CEO Investor Day event in New York City. \n“I could not believe what I saw because I would have known, probably before the news,” Muñoz said, when asked about his initial reaction to the raid. “So I said, something is weird here. How can something happen [and] nobody told me?  And when I go into the details, then I realize it’s not our facility. It’s LG’s battery plant.”\n\n“So I said, something is weird here.”\n\n\n“It’s like something happened in Fox News,” he continued, in response to a question from a CNN reporter. “And they said, ‘How come you didn’t know?‘ I said, ’Hey, I’m working for CNN,’ right? So same deal.”\nMuñoz griped that all the media’s photos of the raid have shown Hyundai’s Metaplant facility rather than the neighboring LG factory. “All the pictures that were shown everywhere, they are pictures of a facility which is different from where the raid happened,” he said.\nHis remarks come a few days after he confirmed that the plant’s construction would be delayed two to three months due to labor shortages. And they come amid the growing fallout from the September 4th raid, which resulted in the arrest of 475 workers, most of whom were from South Korea, at the battery plant that is jointly operated by Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions.\nPresident Donald Trump has sought to placate South Korea after the raid, announcing that he will allow foreign companies to temporarily bring in “people of expertise” to train American workers. But critics say the damage may already have been done, as foreign companies now realize their own workers could get rounded up in Trump’s immigration crackdown.\nThe Hyundai-LG raid was so unusual because it seemed to target a fairly typical situation. When opening a new facility in the US, foreign automakers typically bring a cadre of their own employees to help with the construction and then, once it’s completed, train American workers to operate it. Labor experts warn that the ICE raid in Georgia could chill foreign investment in the US and target particular industries, especially automakers working on EVs. \nMuñoz defended the foreign workers who were in Georgia to help build the factory, arguing that the expertise to build these specialized factories doesn’t exist in the US. And he called for the creation of a new type of visa for highly skilled workers who help develop these enormous projects, to ensure future raids don’t happen. \n“I think the US government has acknowledged that there needs to be a better solution to address this type of situation,” he said. “I think both governments in South Korea and the US are working actively to try to ensure that situations like this don’t happen again.”",
