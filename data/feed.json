      "raw": "Showrunner — the startup that wants to “revolutionize” the entertainment industry by charging people to prompt up AI-generated videos featuring copyrighted IP — is working on a new project to restore an Orson Welles classic.\nOn Friday, Showrunner announced that it has designed a new generative AI model that is meant to help recreate lost footage from The Magnificent Ambersons, Welles’ 1942 adaptation of Booth Tarkington’s 1918 novel about a family whose vast fortune is being decimated by tech-driven industrialization. Though Welles initially crafted a version of the film whose runtime clocked in at 131 minutes, RKO — one of the project’s production companies — cut it down to 88 minutes without the director’s input after he lost control of the editing process. \nThe studio’s cut went on to be nominated for four Oscars and is broadly considered to be one of Welles’ best works. Welles, whom RKO accused of being difficult to work with, disowned the studio’s version of the film. He reportedly later said that “they destroyed Ambersons and it destroyed me.”\nBut Showrunner believes that, by using generative AI, it can bring back the lost footage and give people a chance to see The Magnificent Ambersons as Welles originally intended. In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter about the new project, Showrunner co-founder Edward Saatchi admitted that while generative AI as it currently exists “can’t sustain a story beyond one short episode,” he is confident that “the technology is getting closer to prompting entire films with AI.”\nWhile Welles wrote detailed notes about how he wanted The Magnificent Amersons to be cut, RKO did not follow them and the studio ultimately destroyed the negatives correlating to the film’s lost footage for storage reasons. Showrunner intends to work around those hurdles with a mix of AI-generated approximations of what Welles might have shot and sequences featuring live actors whose faces are manipulated with gen AI to look like members of the original film’s cast. According to IndieWire, Showrunner’s FILM-1 model will be used to generate keyframes for the missing footage, and set photos will be used to create the “spatial setting.”\n To help realize the project, Showrunner has brought on Tom Clive, an AI VFX artist who specializes in face-swapping and previously worked on Alien: Romulus and Here while at Metaphysic Showrunner is also working with filmmaker Brian Rose, who previously attempted his own Ambersons restoration with hand drawn animation based on the 1942 film’s shooting script and archival photographs from the original production.\nSpeaking to NPR in 2023, Rose said that populating his recreated scenes with characters was one of the endeavor’s more challenging aspects. Rose also noted that, because Warner Bros. Discovery holds the intellectual property rights to Welles’ The Magnificent Amberson‘s, there was some uncertainty about whether he could legally release the project, and “the thought was to beg forgiveness later.”\nShowrunner is no stranger to going the “just do it and worry about the consequences later” route. The startup previously made headlines for releasing unauthorized episodes of South Park that were created with its in-house generative AI models. The company seems to be trying to get ahead of any legal trouble by choosing not to monetize its Ambersons project. \nSaatchi told THR that the goal here isn’t to make money off of the lost minutes of footage, but rather to “see them exist in the world after 80 years of people asking ‘might this have been the best film ever made in its original form.'” He also said that Showrunner will gladly give its creation to the IP holders if they “see a marketplace for it and a path for it outside of an academic context.”\nThis is exactly the sort of thing you’d expect to hear from an AI-focused founder on a mission to legitimize their business and secure deals with bigger players in the entertainment game.",

      "raw": "A smart lock is an easy solution to some common problems. Locked yourself out? Need to let a friend in to water the plants? Your latchkey kid lost their key? Hands are full, and it’s raining cats and dogs? A smart lock solves all of these problems and more.\nOne of the best smart home upgrades you can make, a smart lock gives you remote control over access to your house from anywhere, plus easy, key-free ways to unlock and lock your door. Smart locks also remember everything that happened, so they can tell you when your door was unlocked, and sometimes who did it.\nFor most people, control and convenience are big enough selling points. However, smart locks also work nicely with other smart home devices, including video doorbells and smart lighting. My favorite way to integrate locks in my home is with an evening smart home routine, which locks the doors, dims the lights, and sets my thermostat to sleep mode. We have four exterior doors, so it saves me from walking around the house at night checking everything is secure.\nHaving a connected lock on your door is as secure as a standard lock, and sometimes more. Most smart locks have the same security ratings as their non-smart counterparts (see FAQ for more details), and it’s harder to physically pick a lock without a keyway. Plus, any smart lock is more secure than leaving a spare key under a flowerpot.\nI’ve been testing smart door locks for six years and have installed more than 30 for this guide alone. Here are my top picks for your front door. Whether you want the best of the best, don’t want to replace your existing lock, are on a budget, or want a smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock, there are great options for every need.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest smart lock\nBest budget smart(ish) lock\nBest retrofit smart lock\nBest smart lock for renters\nBest fingerprint smart lock\nBest smart lock that works with Apple Home Key\nBest smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock\nBest smart lever lock\nBest smart lock that’s also a video doorbell\nBest facial recognition smart lock\nOther smart locks to consider\nOther smart locks I tested\nWhat’s coming next\nSmart lock FAQs\n\nBest smart lock\nKwikset Halo Select\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent auto-unlock function\nChoice of Wi-Fi or Matter-over-Thread\nGreat design\nDiscreet door sensor\nCan be rekeyed\n\n\nHave to choose between Thread and Kwikset’s auto-unlock\nNo Home Key or biometric access\nTouchscreen shows fingerprints\nProminent Kwikset branding\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $279 $259 at Amazon\n $279 $259 at Home Depot\n $279 $259 at Lowes\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi, Thread / Access options: Key, keycode, app, voice / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: Six to 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI Grade AAA / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Matter (including Apple Home, Samsung SmartThings)\nThe Kwikset Halo Select ($279.99) is a good-looking, reliable smart lock with top-notch security ratings, broad smart home compatibility, and the best auto-unlock function I’ve tested to date.\nI strongly believe a smart lock should look good on your door, and the Halo Select does exactly that, plus it can blend in with both traditional and contemporary door sets. (But I could do without the prominent Kwikset branding.)\nOf the four entry methods — a keyway (which is re-keyable), a touchscreen keypad, app/smart home control, and auto-unlock by location — I liked the last one the best. It worked so well that I didn’t mind that it lacks a fingerprint reader or Apple Home Key.\nMy experience with automatic unlocking on other locks (which uses a combination of Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi to determine your location) has been generally frustrating, but on the Halo Select, it’s been flawless. It unlocks just as I approach my porch, making coming home and opening the door a virtually hands-free experience.\nThe Select can also auto-lock based on your location, not just after a set amount of time as most locks offer. I also like the Halo Select’s LED lock indicator on the touchscreen, which tells you at a glance if the door is locked or unlocked.\nThe Halo Select has built-in Wi-Fi and a Thread radio, but you have to pick one. \nIf you set it up with Wi-Fi, you can use the Kwikset app and connect to Amazon Alexa and Google via the cloud. With Matter, you can connect to those platforms locally and also to Apple Home and others, but you won’t be able to use the Kwikset app after setup. so you lose the auto-unlock feature, among others.\n\nKwikset’s auto-unlock feature worked flawlessly in testing\n\n\nMatter-over-Thread does promise better battery life (I’ll need to test it for longer to determine this) and the ability to easily share the lock with other ecosystems. I set it up in Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings via Matter with no issues and could control it with all three via routines, automations, and voice commands.\nIt’s a shame to have to choose between using Matter and some of this lock’s best features, but this is a problem across Matter, not specific to Kwikset. Kwikset’s solution allows you to use its advanced features today while still having the future-proofing potential of Matter for tomorrow.\nRead my full review of the Kwikset Halo Select.\nBest budget smart(ish) lock\nWyze Lock Bolt\nThis inexpensive smart door lock has a lightning-fast fingerprint reader plus an easy-to-use, backlit keypad. It’s Bluetooth-only (unless you also buy its compatible video doorbell to act as a Wi-Fi bridge), so the battery lasts over a year. At under $80, it’s the best budget lock we tested.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nInexpensive \nGood fingerprint reader\nOffline access codes\nLong battery life\n\n\nNo Wi-Fi \nNo smart home support\nLarge rear housing\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $79.98 at Amazon\n $79.98 at Best Buy\n $79.98 at Wyze\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.0  / Access options: Fingerprint, keypad, app / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Four AA batteries  / Battery life: One year / Security Grade: ANSI/BHMA Grade 3 / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: N/A\nThe Wyze Lock Bolt is a good choice if you want something inexpensive and useful and don’t care about smart home integration — or prefer a lock without it. It’s not sleek or stylish; it’s just a big hunk of black plastic (there’s also a satin nickel version). Out of the box, it doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems, but it does have an easy-to-use backlit keypad and a lightning-fast fingerprint reader. It’ll auto-lock if you want, and it’s half the price of most smart locks in this list. \nIn addition to the fingerprint reader and keypad, the Wyze Lock Bolt can be controlled over Bluetooth, and its range is very good. I could lock the door from my bedroom at the other end of the house using the Wyze app. That’s important, as there’s no way to lock the door on a schedule (although you can enable auto-lock).\n\nThe Wyze doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems \n\n\nThe Bolt doesn’t integrate with smart home platforms, but if you don’t need to control your lock with your voice or plan to add it to any smart home routines, you won’t miss those features. It also delivers up to a year of battery life on four AAs — I tested it for three months and it only lost 15 percent.\nBut without Wi-Fi, I couldn’t check on it or control it when I was away from home, so turning on the auto-lock option is a must. If I wanted to let someone in while I was gone, I couldn’t unlock the door remotely, but I could generate an offline code in the Wyze app and share that. This uses similar technology to two-factor authentication codes and worked perfectly in my testing. \nSince I tested the lock, Wyze has introduced an integration with its Wyze Video Doorbell Pro that lets you unlock the Bolt remotely when paired with the doorbell — but it doesn’t let you lock it remotely, which is odd. Of course, if you enable auto-lock, this is less of an issue.\nBest retrofit smart lock\nNuki Smart Lock\nNuki Smart Lock\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLightning fast\nNice, compact design\nSimple to install\nSupports Wi-Fi and Matter over Thread\nNo account required\nBroad smart home compatibility\n\nSubscription required for remote access (without Matter)\nNo Apple Home Key\nProprietary charging cable\nNo door sensor included\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159 at Amazon \n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Matter-over-Thread / Access options: Key, app, voice, fingerprint and keypad (sold separately) /  Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Non-removable, rechargeable / Battery life: Up to 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe Nuki Smart Lock is the most advanced retrofit smart lock we’ve tested, and a worthy replacement for our previous pick, the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock. It features a compact design and lightning-fast locking — even quicker than manually turning the lock — and it works over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Matter over Thread, the latter of which enables out-of-home control and notifications through any Matter-compatible smart home platform.\nWhereas most smart locks feature a big, bulky design, the Nuki Smart Lock boasts a minimalist style with a premium look and feel. Installation is straightforward — simply remove the thumbturn from your existing deadbolt, replace it with a blackplate, and snap the Nuki into place. Once it’s installed, you can get up and running without signing up for an account, which is a rare feature for a smart lock.\nThe Nuki app gives you access to multiple settings and customization options. In addition to standard features like key sharing with family members and enabling auto-lock and auto-unlock, it supports schedules, an activity log, and a convenient Night Mode, which can lock the door at a set time, disable auto-unlock, and enable auto-lock.\nIf you don’t have a Matter hub and a Thread border router — like a HomePod — Nuki offers a subscription service called Nuki Premium ($5.90 per month). It adds features like remote access, lock activity notifications, and integration with rental platforms like Airbnb. Another possible upgrade is the optional keypad, which supports both PIN codes and fingerprints, making it easy for friends, family, and guests to gain access without needing to download an app. Although the fingerprint reader works well, there is no backlight, making nighttime use tricky without a porch light. The current keypad doesn’t support Apple Home Key, though Nuki is planning to release one later this year with ultra-wideband unlocking (UWB) and NFC support.\nNuki’s smart lock has a built-in battery that can last for months, and it only takes a few hours to fully recharge. While a non-removable battery raises concerns about longevity — smart locks generally use AA batteries — Nuki claims it should last 10 years. After that, the company says a replacement plan will be offered.\nRead our review of the Nuki Smart Lock.\nBest smart lock for renters\nYale Approach Lock with Wi-Fi\nThis slimline, easy-to-install, inexpensive retrofit lock is a simple solution with a year of battery life. It requires a plug-in bridge for out-of-home control and doesn’t work with Apple Home. The optional keypad adds to the cost but also to the convenience. \n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nEasy install\nOption of fingerprint keypad\nA year of battery life\n\nRequires Wi-Fi bridge\nKeypad is big and ugly\nNo support for Matter\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129.99 $96.34 at Amazon\n $229.99 at Yale (with fingerprint keypad)\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (with plug-in module) / Access options: Key, app, voice, keypad and fingerprint reader sold separately / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Four AA alkaline batteries / Battery life: 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nStarting at $130, the Yale Approach is a more affordable retrofit lock with no monthly subscription. It’s super easy to install, looks nice, and has a good list of features — auto-lock, auto-unlock, app and voice control. Add the Bluetooth keypad to get one-touch locking, key code, and fingerprint access.\nThe Approach replaces your thumb turn, so you can still use your current lock and key — making it a great option if you are renting and don’t want to annoy your landlord. It has a nice, slim profile and blends in better than the rear housing of most smart locks.\nThe lock comes in black or silver and took me less than five minutes to install. It uses four AA batteries and promises 12 months of battery life. This is because there is no built-in Wi-Fi; instead, it uses an included plug-in bridge.\nThe bridge adds out-of-home control and connection to smart home platforms, including Alexa and Google Home, but there’s no Apple Home support). This allows for voice control and adding it to smart home routines. Yale told me there’s an onboard Thread radio that will be activated to support Matter, but didn’t say when this would arrive.\nThe optional Bluetooth keypad lets you control the lock from the outside without using an app or key, and it worked promptly and reliably. There’s the option of a fingerprint version, and that was similarly a good experience — just touch and open. The keypad also allows you to lock the door when you leave by pressing the Yale logo button. \nThe keys are a bit sensitive; I frequently get double inputs when pressing. But I liked the LED indicator that notifies you with green if your code was accepted or red if there’s an issue. This made it easy to know if the input worked, as the lock is very quiet — it’s hard to hear it locking or unlocking.\nMy biggest disappointment is the look of the keypad. It’s big, wide, and black, with prominent white numbers that don’t disappear when not in use — it looks a bit like a toy keypad on your door.\nBest fingerprint smart lock\nYale Assure Lock 2 Touch\nThis fingerprint lock is fast and reliable, and the keypad is a good backup option for visitors. It works with Apple Home and can be upgraded to support Wi-Fi — which you’ll need for remote unlocking, Android phones, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home support. Auto-unlock can open the door as you approach, and you can also use a key if you just can’t let go.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFast fingerprint reader\nNice, compact design\nWorks with Apple Home\nCompatible with Wi-Fi and Z-Wave\n\nTouchscreen isn’t intuitive\nAuto-unlock can be slow / unreliable\nNo Matter support\nProminent Yale branding\nAdditional connectivity options cost extra\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $189.99 $139.99 at Amazon (Bluetooth)\n $279.99 $246.98 at Amazon (Wi-Fi)\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth (can add Wi-Fi, Z-Wave) / Access options: Key, keypad, fingerprint reader, app, voice / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: Six months to a year / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI/BHMA Grade 2 / Works with: Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe Yale Assure 2 line — previously my top pick — has something for everyone. There’s an option with or without a keyway, with a touchscreen keypad or a physical keypad, or with Apple Home Key, but my favorite model is the Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with a built-in fingerprint reader. It costs $279.99, and the built-in fingerprint reader is fast and efficient. I tested the touchscreen version, but Yale recently released a keypad version. Unless you really value the clean look of the touchscreen (which is blank when off), go with the keypad — it’s much easier to use.\nThe Yale Assure 2 is a good-looking lock that works with every smart home platform with its swappable modules. Its slimline design (both front and back), wide smart home compatibility, easy-to-use app, and good selection of unlocking options — including fingerprint unlock — make it a great option for your front door. \nThe lock supports Bluetooth out of the box and works with the Yale Access app and Apple Home app (which adds remote unlocking if you have an Apple Home hub). Along with a keycode, fingerprint reader, or key, you can also choose to use auto-unlocking. Auto-unlock is a decent alternative to fingerprint unlock, but I found I often had to wait at the door for a second or two before it worked. Still, it’s faster than fumbling through a purse for keys when your hands are full.\nSupport for other platforms and remote unlocking comes through Yale’s ingenious swappable networking modules, which cost around $80 each. There’s a Wi-Fi module to add Alexa and Google Home integration and a Z-Wave module for compatibility with (some) SmartThings hubs, Ring Alarm, and other Z-Wave hubs. Yale promised support for Matter via a Matter-over-Thread module back in 2022, but this still hasn’t materialized. They have announced a different lock that uses Thread, but it doesn’t have a fingerprint reader. I plan to test this soon.\nI tested the Wi-Fi module in the Assure 2 Touch, which worked well with Amazon Alexa and Google Home. It allowed me to add the lock to Alexa Routines, lock and unlock it with my voice, and control it away from home. The downside is that control over Wi-Fi is considerably slower than over Bluetooth and drains the battery more quickly. Yale estimates up to a year on Bluetooth only, compared to six months over Wi-Fi; I got about four months.\nRead my review of the Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch.\nBest smart lock that works with Apple Home Key\nSchlage Encode Plus\nThe Encode Plus is a high-end, reliable smart lock that works with Apple Home and has Home Key compatibility. It also has a Thread radio on board, which helps with connectivity and battery life.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSupport for Apple Home and Home Key\nWorks over Thread\nEasy-to-use keypad\nNice design options that may match your hardware\n\nExpensive\nQuite loud\nNo Matter support\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $259 at Amazon\n $329 $259 at The Home Depot\n $297.09 at Build\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi or Thread / Access options: Key, keypad, app, voice, Apple Home Key / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: Up to six months / Security Grade: ANSI Grade 1 / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Apple Home (Home Key), Amazon Alexa, Ring, and Google Home\nApple Home Key lets you use your iPhone or Apple Watch to tap to unlock your door in much the same way as you tap to pay. It uses an NFC chip in the lock, and is fast, efficient, and secure. There are no apps to open, no buttons to press, and no need to unlock your phone (although you can add that step as an extra security layer). However, it does require an Apple device; it won’t work on Android. \nHome Key took a while to gain adoption, but there are now several options (and should soon be more as Apple has made it part of Matter). The Schlage Encode Plus is still the best option — if one of the most expensive — as it has a built-in keypad and works over Thread. \nThe keypad is useful for giving access to people with whom you can’t share a Home Key (sharing is quite limited), and Thread makes for a rock-solid connection. While it won’t be updated to support Matter, the Thread radio adds better battery life and a more stable connection to Apple Home than Bluetooth. I have had numerous connectivity issues in HomeKit with Bluetooth-only locks.\nTo use Home Key, you need to have an Apple Home Hub, such as an Apple TV or HomePod. Adding the lock to the Home app automatically adds the Home Key card to your Wallet, as well as that of anyone else you have added to your Apple Home. That’s much easier than getting household members to download a whole new app for the door lock. I should know — I try regularly. \nTo allow someone not in your household to control the lock, you’ll have to give them a standard PIN, which you can do in the Apple Home app or the Schlage Encode app. If you like, you can set this lock up entirely in the Home app and never have to use the manufacturer’s app. \nRead our review of the Schlage Encode Plus.\nBest smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock\nLevel Lock Plus\nThe Level Lock Plus packs all the smarts and power into the deadbolt itself, leaving the rest of your lock looking like a normal lock. It works with Apple’s Home Key, auto-unlocks, has the option of a separate keypad, and supports Matter-over-Thread. \n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nNo branding\nSmall and unobtrusive\nSupports Home Key\nWorks over Thread\nBroad smart home compatibility through Matter\n\nExpensive\nKeypad costs extra\nAuto-unlock can be unreliable\nNot ideal for older doors\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329 $246.75 at Amazon\n $329 $246.75 at Best Buy\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth, Thread, Wi-Fi with bridge / Access options: Key, app, voice, keypad (sold separately), Apple Home Key / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: One CR2 battery / Battery life: One year / Guest codes: Yes / Security Grade: ANSI/BHMA: Grade 1 / Works with: Matter, Apple Home, Ring \nWant a smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock? Level packs all the technology inside the deadbolt — including the single CR2 battery that gets up to a year of battery life.\nThe Level Lock Plus works with Apple’s Home Key and recently started supporting Matter over Thread. You can also control it with a key, auto-unlock, touch-to-unlock, the app, and smart home integrations. If you don’t use an iPhone or have family members who don’t, you’ll want to get the Bluetooth keypad (from $79) to give you another option for access. The lock also comes with two NFC cards you can hand out.\nThe Level Lock Plus replaces the whole lock, deadbolt and all, but still looks like a traditional door lock — both in front and behind the door. There is no branding at all — this is the only smart lock I’ve tested that isn’t a tiny advertisement on my front door. There’s also the option of the Level Bolt, which only replaces the deadbolt of your existing lock. This has all the same features, bar Home Key and touch-to-unlock, and it costs significantly less. \nLevel locks work over Bluetooth out of the box and can connect to an Apple Home hub for out-of-home control. If you don’t have a HomePod or Apple TV, get the Level Lock Plus with Wi-Fi, which comes with a Connect Wi-Fi bridge. Or you can connect it to Matter for smart home and out-of-home control. You’ll need a Matter controller, which can be a HomePod or Amazon Echo smart speaker, among other options (See FAQ).\nThe Level lock also has auto-unlocking and touch-to-unlock, though with some quirks: it’s one or the other, not both. And neither works unless you leave the geofence area and come back. So if you leave the house, lock the door, get in your car, remember you forgot something, and go back to your door, it won’t unlock automatically. This is why I prefer Home Key or a keypad for unlocking.\nBased on my testing of the lock on three different doors, it is worth noting that the full replacement Level locks don’t work well with older doors. I would only consider installing this if your door lines up perfectly with the strike plate.\nLevel locks are very expensive; the Plus costs $329 ($349 for the Wi-Fi version). But it’s the way to go for an invisible smart lock that works well. \nRead my review of the Level Lock Plus.\nBest smart lever lock\nAqara Smart Lock U300\nThe first single-borehole smart lock to work with Apple Home Key, the U300 can also be unlocked with a fingerprint, making it an easy, smart addition for shed, garage, or home office doors. It works over Thread and is Matter compatible, with up to a 10-month battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229.99 $179.99 at Amazon\n\nConnectivity: Thread / Access options: Key, app, voice, keypad, NFC tag, Apple Home Key / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: 10 months / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Matter, Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe Aqara U300 is a lever-style smart lock; it replaces a knob or lever lock on a door with a single borehole rather than a door with a deadbolt lock with two holes. This type of lock is traditionally found on interior doors, pedestrian doors into garages, or side doors.\nThere are options for smart lever locks from Yale, Schlage, and Lockly, but the U300 is the only one with Home Key compatibility and a built-in fingerprint reader. It also works over Thread and supports Matter.\nI installed it on my garage door, and it works like a charm. The fingerprint reader is right where you put your thumb to open the door, so I barely notice it unlocking as I walk in. It also has a keypad, and I can use my iPhone or Apple Watch for Home Key. It’s set to auto-lock by default, but you can enable passage mode directly on the lock if you don’t want it to stay locked all the time.\nIt paired to Matter easily — I set it up in Apple Home and could add a code and Home Key all without even opening the Aqara app. Because it uses Thread, there’s no need for an Aqara hub. Thread also enables up to 10 months of battery life, according to Aqara.\nI love the idea of using smart locks on other doors in my home. I could see this working on a basement door, a home office, or any other room you like to keep people out of. However, I would like to see a way to permanently enable passage mode. Currently, you have to do it on the device, and it reverts to auto-lock after an undetermined period. This makes it somewhat useless for interior doors. It’s also very large and only comes in black or silver, so it likely wouldn’t blend in with your interior decor. A slimmer option, in more colorways, designed for inside use would be nice to see.\nThe U300 is expensive at $230, but it’s similar to other outdoor-rated options (it’s IPX4-rated). The addition of Thread — a protocol that works over a mesh network — makes it easier to extend connectivity further to places like a shed or garage.\nBest smart lock that’s also a video doorbell\nEufy FamiLock S3 Max\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nDigital peephole is useful\nPalm unlock is fast\nNo subscription fees for video\nLock supports Matter\nFacial recognition with HomeBase\n\nVery expensive\nNighttime video is not great\nNo package detection\nHomeBase required for most smart alerts\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 at Amazon\n $399.99 at Best Buy\n $399.99 at Eufy\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi or Eufy HomeBase / Access options: Key, palm unlock, keypad, app, voice / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, AAA backup / Battery life: Five months / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI Grade 1 / Works with: Matter (including Apple Home), Amazon Alexa, and Google Home\nEufy’s new FamiLock S3 Max combines a smart lock and video doorbell in one device and features a digital peephole and a wave-to-unlock function. It also has a keyway and keypad and supports Matter-over-Wi-Fi, so it can work with all the major smart home platforms.\nMy favorite of all these features is the video screen on the inside part of the lock, which shows a live feed of who is on the other side of the door. If you have a peephole or a window in your door, this might not be much use — and you can opt to get the lock without the screen for $50 less. But as a quick way to confirm who is at your door before opening it, it’s super handy.\nThe lock has another fairly unique feature: palm vein recognition technology. This lets you wave your hand over it to unlock it, and is an alternative form of biometric access to the popular fingerprint reader.\nPalm unlocking isn’t any faster or easier than using your fingerprint, though, and I found it harder to get used to. But once I got the hang of it, it worked reliably. Both my kids also picked it up quickly, and my husband, who has trouble with fingerprint locks in general, really liked it.\nThe main reason to buy this lock is for the video doorbell feature. The FamiLock’s 2K camera provides clear, crisp video during daylight hours and decent night vision, although my protruding door frame reflected the LEDs, causing the footage to blow out a bit.\nThe 180-degree diagonal field of view meant I could see top to bottom and all of one side (not the other side, though, due to the aforementioned door frame). But packages and people were clearly visible, which is most of what you want to see with a doorbell camera.\nThere’s no fee for viewing recorded footage of visitors in the Eufy app, and videos are stored locally on the device. Live view and recording pulled up promptly in the app, and the doorbell can alert you when it sees a person. For more advanced smart alerts, including facial recognition, you need to connect it to a Eufy HomeBase.\nBear in mind, Matter integration only controls the lock, as cameras aren’t supported by the standard yet, so the benefits of using Matter are fairly limited. (If you’re looking for a biometric Matter lock, Eufy’s E30 is a good fingerprint lock that uses Matter-over-Thread.)\nAdding a video doorbell to a smart lock puts a lot of strain on the battery. While you can adjust several settings to help save power, Eufy says you’ll only get about five months of battery life from the lock’s giant 15,000mAh removable battery. Handily, four AAA backup batteries are tucked into the top to keep it functioning while you’re recharging the battery (which takes a while). I’ve been testing it for over a week, and the battery indicator hasn’t budged yet.\nAt $400, this is a very expensive lock, but it works well and provides dual functionality of a doorbell and door lock.\nRead my review of the Eufy FamiLock S3 Max.\nBest facial recognition smart lock\nLockly Visage\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFacial recognition is super fast\nHome Key and a fingerprint reader\nCompact design\nComes with two rechargeable batteries\n\nKeypad is hard to see, fiddly to use\nWired door sensor is ugly\nNo support for Matter\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349 at Amazon\n $349 at The Home Depot\n $349 at Lockly\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi (2.4gHz) / Access options: Fingerprint, facial recognition, app, voice, keypad, Home Key, key / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: 10,000mAh rechargeable / Battery life: Eight months / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI Grade 1 / Works with: Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nI was very impressed with the Lockly Visage. The first facial recognition residential smart lock on the market, it also features a fingerprint reader, a keypad, a keyway, and Apple Home Key — that’s a lot of high-tech ways to unlock your door. And while it’s probably too much lock for most people, if you are a super smart home user or a major gadget nerd, you’ll love this lock.\nI was skeptical about the facial unlocking at first, but it worked really well, opening a second or two before I put my hand on the handle. The only caveat is that I had to be approaching face-on, which in most cases I was, but the couple of times I approached from a slightly odd angle, it failed to unlock. In those cases, though, I had the option of using my fingerprint or Home Key.\nThere’s also a touchscreen keypad, which is mainly useful for handing out codes to guests and visitors whose faces and fingers you don’t want to scan into your lock. The keypad is probably my least favorite part of the lock; it’s very small, which is good for the overall look, but fiddly to access. It’s also hard to see in bright light. But with all the other ways to unlock, this isn’t a deal-breaker.\nNote that the Visage doesn’t take video or still images; its infrared camera is only used for facial recognition, data for which is stored on the device. Lockly does have a video doorbell version for $429, though that doesn’t have facial recognition.\nSurprisingly, despite all the tech packed into it, the lock is compact and stylish-looking and works with the redesigned Lockly Home app, which is now more straightforward and easier to use. The lock works over Wi-Fi and supports Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa, but there’s no support for Matter.\nLockly claims eight months of battery life with its included rechargeable 10,000mAh battery. Uniquely, it comes with two batteries, so you can swap one and keep the lock online while charging the other. \nAt $350, the Lockly Visage is very expensive, but considering the tech packed into this lock, plus the two batteries, it’s not outrageous. Its solid build, broad smart home compatibility, and multiple very cool ways to control it make this a great lock.\nOther smart locks to consider\nEufy’s E30 smart lock works with both Matter-over-Thread and Wi-Fi. It has a fingerprint reader, key, and keypad, and you can use the fingerprint access through the Eufy app while connecting it to platforms like Apple Home through Matter. Unlike the Kwikset Halo Select, you can use Wi-Fi and Thread simultaneously, which is unusual. I’ve not tested it long enough to determine if you still benefit from Thread’s better battery life. It’s cheaper than the Halo, has a fingerprint reader instead of auto-unlock, and promises 8 months of battery life. It can also integrate with a Eufy doorbell to control it from a live view. It has a nice compact design, but the rear housing is huge to fit 8 AA batteries. The lock is loud in operation, and the fingerprint reader was finicky; it also has the lowest ANSI/BHMA rating.\nU-tec’s Bolt Fingerprint Matter works over Thread and can be set up directly in your smart home platform of choice — no need to use U-tec’s U Home. But if you want to use its built-in fingerprint reader, you’ll need to download the app. And if you don’t use it, then it’s kind of a waste of space, so the whole “you only need one app” feature falls flat. I also don’t love the design of the Ultraloqs, while smaller on the exterior than most smart locks, they are squat and chunky looking, resembling a combination lock rather than door hardware. It also uses eight batteries, which is an absurd amount, and is very noisy.\nIf you’re an Amazon Alexa Ring household, the Schlage Encode Wifi lock is a good option; it integrates with the Ring app, so you can lock and unlock it while viewing a live feed from your Ring doorbell. Its design will also match a Schlage door set, which is important for some people. There’s no door-sensing or auto-unlock option, but you have three reliable ways to get in: a key, a PIN, and the app. It also lasts at least six months on one set of four AAs.\nIf you want Home Key but the Schlage is too expensive or not your style, the Aqara U50 is a good, inexpensive alternative that’s less than half the price of the Schlage. It doesn’t have as good a build quality, and the keypad is a bit finicky, but it works with Apple Home and Home Key out of the box. (You‘ll need an Aqara hub for any other smart home integrations, including Matter.) It also pairs with Aqara’s G4 video doorbell to unlock the door while viewing video from the live feed. (Aqara has a doorbell that’s also a hub coming soon).\nThe Aqara Smart Lock U100 is a Matter-compatible smart lock that also works with Apple HomeKit and Home Key. A full replacement deadlock that can be unlocked by key, keypad, NFC key fob, fingerprint, voice control, through an app, or with Apple Home Key. It’s a good lock, but its smart home integrations are complicated, and there are now better options.\nThe Yale Assure SL with Matter Module is a Matter-over-Thread deadbolt smart lock. It’s simple, with a clean design and a touchscreen keypad for entry. There’s no keyway, fingerprint reader, or Apple Home Key, but in terms of simplicity, reliability, and future-proofing, it’s a good option. It’s one of the few locks you can connect directly to your smart home platform of choice without needing to download the manufacturer’s app — the Assure SL doesn’t even work with Yale’s app.\nThe SwitchBot Lock Pro is an all-around upgrade to one of my previous favorite locks, the SwitchBot lock (which is now discontinued). It’s a great solution if you have an unusual lock, as it can work on almost any door; it has higher-quality materials than the original, but now requires you to replace the rear of your lock (as most retrofit locks do). It does support Matter through a bridge, but for $200, I would still opt for Nuki.\nThe Kwikset Halo Touch is a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi fingerprint lock with a traditional keyway. As there’s no keypad, it looks more like a standard lock with the bonus of easy access. This is more limiting when it comes to sharing access to your door, but it’s a good solution for anyone who wants a simple key-free way into their home and knows they won’t need to share lots of digital keys.\nThe Tapo DL100 is a $70 smart lock with built-in Wi-Fi, a keypad, and a physical key, plus access via the Tapo mobile app and smart home integrations. It’s cheaper than my budget pick, the Wyze Bolt, and includes Wi-Fi for remote access, but you don’t get a fingerprint reader. It works with Tapo’s excellent video doorbells.\nThe SwitchBot Lock Ultra Vision is a retrofit smart lock that works with a keypad that has facial recognition built in. The keypad also has a fingerprint reader and auto-unlock. The lock can work with almost any style of door lock, connects over Bluetooth, and works with Apple Home (through Matter), Amazon Alexa, and Google Home with a SwitchBot hub.\nThe Yale Smart Lock with Matter is a $170 smart lock that works over Thread and is a full-deadbolt replacement featuring a keypad and keyway for access. It’s designed to pair with Google’s Nest video doorbells.\nOther smart locks I tested\nThe Aqara U200 is $269.99. That’s a lot for a retrofit lock — even with support for Thread, Matter, and Home Key. It has a keypad/fingerprint reader included; most retrofit locks charge extra for one. The keypad enables Apple Home Key, and this is the only retrofit lock that works with it. If that’s something you want, then this is the only option for now. Otherwise, you can get all the same functionality with the Yale Approach — plus auto-unlock — for $40 less.\nU-tec’s Ultraloq Bolt Fingerprint with Wi-Fi is the newest version of an earlier pick for best lock, the U-Bolt Pro with Wi-Fi. This version adds support for Apple Home (that’s the $199 one), but not Home Key, and a slight redesign — you no longer have to pop half the lock collar off to get to the keyhole, which is a good upgrade. It still has a fingerprint reader and auto-unlock.\nThe Lockly Vision Elite is a smart lock with a video doorbell. It’s very expensive, and it’s not a great video doorbell. Motion detection is spotty, and the camera lacks people or package detection. It works with Amazon Alexa and Google Home, but not Apple Home or Matter. Read our review.\nThe Eufy Smart Lock Touch is a very good lock in terms of function — it has an easy-to-use fingerprint reader, a nice big touchscreen keypad, the option of a key, and Wi-Fi built in. But it is just too big and techie-looking for most people’s front doors. I do like the removable 10,000mAh battery, which went eight months before needing to recharge (with a USB-A cable). But that’s also why this lock is so big.\nThe Eufy Video Smart Lock is similarly huge and very expensive; it requires a bridge to connect to Wi-Fi, and the Eufy FamiLock offers way more features for just $50 more.\nThe August Wi-Fi Smart Lock was our previous pick for the best retrofit smart lock. Its sleek, all-metal design doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb. With built-in Wi-Fi, there’s no need for an additional bridge, and it easily integrates with an optional Yale keypad for keycode access. The lock also offers an auto-unlock feature, adding convenience when your keys aren’t handy. That said, during testing, we found the auto-unlock feature wasn’t failproof, so you may need to use your phone to get inside occasionally. Read our review.\nThe Level Lock Pro is the latest smart lock from Level. At $349, it features an upgraded processor, door sensing, a passive infrared sensor for presence detection, and Matter-over-Thread support in a package that looks like a regular deadbolt. Read our impressions.\nWhat’s coming next\nThe Schlage Sense Pro is the company’s first lock to support  Matter and one of the first to use ultra-wideband technology (UWB) for hands-free unlocking. It has a keypad but no keyway and will work with the Aliro standard when it launches. This means it should support a version of Apple Home Key.\nU-tec’s Ultraloq Bolt Mission is a $400 lock that will work with UWB for hands-free unlocking; it also has a keypad and a keyway, and the company says it will support Matter.\nThe Ultraloq Bolt NFC HomeKey ($249) is U-tec’s first Apple Home Key smart lock slated for release soon. There’s no fingerprint reader, but there is a keypad and a physical key. Built-in Wi-Fi adds support for Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings.\nKwikset is launching a few new smart locks later this year. The Halo Select Plus is an NFC-enabled version of Kwikset’s Halo Select, with features like a touchscreen keypad, Matter-over-Thread support, built-in Wi-Fi, and hands-free auto-unlock. Plus, it supports a new tap-to-unlock feature that uses a compatible phone or watch as your key. The company is also set to launch the Aura Reach later this year, a Matter-over-Thread version of its mid-range Aura line.\nSmart lock FAQs\nPhotography by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, September 5th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability.

      "raw": "The 13.8-inch Surface Laptop is Microsoft’s closest rival to the MacBook Air, using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chipsets for exceptional battery life. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\t\n\nIf you want a great laptop, you’re going to have to fork over a ton of money, right? Not necessarily. There are dozens of good laptops on the market at various price points. However, it can feel overwhelming to find the right one for your needs (some are better suited for, say, college students, whereas others are ideal for gamers).\nThat’s why we’ve come up with this list of some of the best laptop deals available right now. In addition to the latest discounts, we’ll share each discounted model’s best features (and downsides) to give you more clarity during your shopping journey. And if you need to do more research, you can also check out our guides to the best laptops on the market and the top gaming laptops.\nThe best laptop deals\nApple MacBook deals\nM1 MacBook Air\n2020 MacBook Air with M1 (256GB)\nThe 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold).\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $649 $599 at Walmart\n\nApple itself no longer sells the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1 — and hasn’t for years — but you can still get this solid laptop for $599.99 ($50 off) at Walmart. The 2020 model is available in one configuration, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but it’s still capable at handling basic tasks like a champ, including streaming video, browsing, and dealing with documents. You can also use the M1 MacBook Air for creative work in Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Logic, and Pixelmator, though you may experience slowdown due to its low 8GB of memory.\nThe laptop’s battery lasted between eight and ten hours when we originally reviewed it, and those figures should be mostly accurate, barring some differences likely caused by operating system updates. In addition to offering great performance for its price, the laptop also comes with other nice-to-have features, including a comfortable keyboard and an excellent trackpad. Just note its 720p webcam isn’t particularly good, so if a high-resolution webcam matters a lot to you, you may want to buy one separately. Also, be aware that, due to the limitations of the M1 chip, you can only use one external display at a time and port selection is also more limited than newer models.\nM2 MacBook Air\n13-inch MacBook Air with M2 (2022)\nThe 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $699 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n\nApple’s 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip is a significant leap above the M1 model it succeeded, both in terms of design and performance. The old wedge-shaped look was replaced for a more squared-off design that’s still used by the current-generation MacBook Air. It has a 1080p webcam, which was a welcome improvement given the disappointing camera on the 2020 M1 model. It’s also much lighter and thus more portable as well, yet it retains features like MagSafe charging and Touch ID, as well as a nice display.\nDespite its age, the M2 processor inside of this machine is still powerful enough to handle many tasks, from common ones such as browsing to more complex and creative projects. Compared to newer, pricier models, this one unsurprisingly struggles with gaming. That being said, it’s capable of running Cyberpunk 2077. The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 launched with 8GB of RAM, but that configuration became unavailable last year when Apple made 16GB the new standard. \nWhile a well-rounded laptop overall, there is one key area where Apple’s M1 model is better: storage. The base M2 MacBook Air with 256GB of storage is actually slower than its predecessor because it’s stored in a single NAND chip. This was corrected in subsequent MacBook Air models, so the slowdown is unique to M2 machines with 256GB of storage. Also, be aware as well that port selection isn’t great, and the included display notch — which is also found on both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros — can make using the menu bar more challenging until you get used to it. If that doesn’t bother you, however, you can get a configuration with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, an 8-core CPU and GPU for $699 ($100 off) at Best Buy.\nM4 MacBook Air\n13-inch Apple MacBook Air 13 (2025, M4)\nThe M4 MacBook Air has a speedy processor, and double the RAM of previous models. It has a thin and light design, all day battery life, and still starts with 256GB of storage. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 $897.5 at Amazon\n $999 $899 at B&H Photo\n $999 $899 at Adorama\n\nThe 13-inch MacBook Air with M4 is Apple’s latest thin and lightweight laptop, and it’s our top pick in The Verge’s guide to the best laptops right now. It’s not a MacBook Pro, but Apple’s M4 processor in the Air is still mighty capable. In our tests, it only throttled under heavy load from creative applications, which is understandable given its fanless design. The machine comes with 16GB of RAM as standard rather than an optional upgrade, but the base configuration still comes with just 256GB of storage, so be mindful of that limitation if you work with a lot of larger files. \nApple hasn’t increased the number of ports on a MacBook Air since reintroducing MagSafe to the M2 model in 2022, but this generation has Thunderbolt 4 ports rather than Thunderbolt 3 for faster file transfer speeds. Another notable addition is the 1080p Center Stage camera from the MacBook Pro, so you’ll stay in frame if you move around on a video call. Battery life should last all day, though your experience will vary depending on how hard you push this machine. \nYou can currently get a configuration of the 13-inch with M4 with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and a 10-core CPU and GPU for around $897.50 ($102 off) at Amazon, and $899.99 at B&H Photo. If you need a larger screen, you can get the 15-inch MacBook Air with the same specs for $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4\nThe entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — and a 512GB SSD for the same starting price of $1,599. It also gets a third USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port and comes in a space black option.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1426.21 at Amazon\n $1599 $1499 at B&H Photo\n\n\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro\nThe 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 12-core / 16-core M4 Pro chip starts with 24GB of RAM — a 6GB increase over the prior generation. It also has a 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, an optional nano-texture display, and a 12-megapixel webcam.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $1699 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $1699 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $1699 at B&H Photo (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\n\n16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM and offers more computing cores (14 for the CPU and 20 for the GPU) compared to the 14-inch model. It also picks up Thunderbolt 5 ports and a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $2227 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $2299 at B&H Photo (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $2399 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nThe M4 generation MacBook Pros are Apple’s fastest laptops yet. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, and comes equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a MagSafe charging port. It can send video to two external displays simultaneously (the previous generation could only handle one) and has an improved 12-megapixel Center Stage camera with better video quality. \nThe M4 MacBook Pro and M4 MacBook Air run on the same chip, but the Pro’s cooling system is better, so it handles resource-intensive tasks (including games) without throttling as easily. The laptop’s 14.2-inch screen is bright (up to 1,600 nits when viewing HDR content), and supports the P3 color gamut, both of which are important to professionals who rely on color accuracy when editing photos and video. The display has a 120Hz refresh rate, so scrolling through webpages or moving windows around should appear smoother than 60Hz screens. In our stress test, which included editing 33-megapixel RAW images and working with a large photo library in Adobe Lightroom, the laptop ran for 12 hours without kicking up the fans or feeling hot to the touch. \nIf you want even more power, you can jump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro processor. It comes with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, a 12-core CPU, and a 16-core GPU. The M4 Pro MacBook Pro has over twice the memory bandwidth of the base M4 MacBook Pro, so it should perform better across the board. That said, it might be tough to notice the benefits of its extra memory and processing power during casual use, but it will come in handy when you’re pushing the laptop to the limits while video editing or playing games. It has three Thunderbolt 5 ports, and you can use that extra bandwidth with an external SSD with fast transfer speeds, to name an example. You can also get the MacBook Pro with M4 Pro with a 16-inch screen if you’d like to work on a larger display. \nRight now, the 14-inch M4 model with 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD and 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU is $1,426 ($173 off) at Amazon. You can get a 14-inch M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 12-core CPU, and 16-core GPU for around $1,699 at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The 16-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 14-core CPU, and 20-core GPU is currently on sale for $2,227 ($272 off) at Amazon. \nMicrosoft Surface deals\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition\nThe 13.8-inch Surface Laptop is Microsoft’s closest rival to the MacBook Air, using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chipsets for exceptional battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $888.86 at B&H Photo (X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512 SSD)\n $1199.99 $899 at Amazon (X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1399.99 $949.99 at Amazon Buy (X Elite, 16GB RAM, 512 SSD)\n\nWe chose Microsoft’s 7th Edition Surface Laptop as one of the best laptops you can get because it’s the top Snapdragon Copilot Plus PC we’ve tried yet. The laptop runs on a power-efficient ARM processor that doesn’t skimp on performance. Its 13.8-inch 2,304 x 1,536 120Hz screen supports Dolby Vision HDR (High Dynamic Range) and looks very nice. It has a large, precision haptic trackpad that gives you plenty of room to tap and swipe, an offers satisfying feedback no matter where you press it. \nThe laptop has a pair of USB 4 ports, one USB-A 3.1 Gen 1 port, plus a headphone jack. One of the concerns of using an ARM-based Windows PC has been software compatibility, but this model proves that’s no longer something to be as worried about. It runs Photoshop, and apps compiled for X86 processors work thanks to Microsoft’s Prism emulator. Be sure to check the compatibility of the specific Windows app you rely, though, as there’s still a chance they won’t work as intended. \nEven after our toughest tests, the battery lasted seven hours. That’s with 100 percent screen brightness, after downloading multiple Steam games, attending video calls, and running through multiple projects in Photoshop. Using the laptop with less power-hungry apps, including Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, and Chrome, the laptop used just 30 percent of its battery in seven hours. For the best battery life, you’ll want to stick to using native ARM apps when possible. If you want to make the switch to an ARM-based laptop to get some of the benefits MacBook users have had for years, the 7th Generation Surface Laptop is worth checking out.\nYou can get a 13.8-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop (7th Edition) with a Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD for around $888.86 ($211 off) at B&H Photo and Amazon. A model with the Snapdragon X Elite processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is on sale for $949.99 ($450 off) at Amazon.\nAsus laptop deals\nAsus Zenbook S 16\nAsus Zenbook S 16\nThe Asus Zenbook S 16 features AMD’s Ryzen AI mobile processors. It’s one of the thinnest and lightest 16-inch laptops available and doesn’t cut corners on performance. It’s a mighty machine that can handle all sorts of heavy workloads with ease and grace.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $1199.99 at Asus\n\nWe chose Asus’ Zenbook S 16 as another one of our top recommendations for students, but it’s a solid laptop for anyone who wants a large-screened Windows laptop. In our tests, the 16-inch 120Hz 3K (2,880 x 1,800) OLED display emits vivid colors and excellent contrast. The laptop was more than capable of handling common tasks, including video chats using its 1080p webcam, music streaming, but its graphics and gaming performance is what really sets it apart from laptops in its size and price classes. \nThis machine runs Cyberpunk 2077 at around 77 frames per second with the resolution set to 1080p with AMD’s FSR 2.1 upscaling software turned on. The laptop isn’t designed for gaming, but it’s good to know it’s up to the task if you’re willing to turn down some graphical settings. The Zenbook S 16’s battery lasted 11 hours during our testing. However, the percentage indicator in the Windows taskbar would often fluctuate, making it difficult to pin down exactly how much juice was left. \nYou can get a configuration of the laptop with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor for $1,199.99 ($600 off) from Asus. To get the deal, which lasts through September 7th, you’ll need to sign up for a free Asus membership.\nAsus ROG Strix Scar 16 (2025, RTX 5080)\nAsus ROG Strix Scar 16 (2025, RTX 5080)\nAsus’ ROG Strix Scar 16 is a powerful gaming laptop configured with a 16-inch 2.5K 240Hz screen, Nvidia 5080 graphics card, Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $3299.99 $2899 at Walmart\n $3299.99 $2899.99 at Best Buy\n\nIf you want to take a powerful gaming PC with you on the go, Asus’ ROG Strix Scar 16 is one of the best we recommend. It has a 16-inch 240Hz Mini LED display with a resolution of 2,560 x 1,600. The screen can’t quite match an OLED when it comes to rich contrast, but you get Dolby Vision HDR here, and its color accuracy impressed us in our tests. The laptop has larger keys instead of a number pad, which makes sense for a gaming-focused laptop. If you need a number pad, you can bring up a touch-sensitive one by clicking and holding the top part of the laptop’s large trackpad. \nUnder the hood, Asus fitted the ROG Strix Scar 16 with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32GB of RAM, 2TB of storage, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card with 16GB of dedicated video memory. The laptop’s display supports Nvidia’s G-Sync technology, so you shouldn’t see screen tearing or other graphical anomalies when playing games. The laptop has three USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, an ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. You can use either the HDMI 2.1 port or Thunderbolt 5 ports to carry a 4K 120Hz video signal to a compatible TV or gaming monitor. \nIn case aesthetics matter to you, the ROG Strix Scar 16 has RGB lighting on its underside as well as a dot-matrix LED array that can display animations on its lid. These features aren’t new, but each can add some flair to your setup. Right now, you can get the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 in its base configuration for around $2,899.99 ($400 off) at Walmart and Best Buy.\nThe best Lenovo laptop deals\nLenovo Yoga Book 9i (2024)\nLenovo Yoga Book 9i (2024)\nThe Lenovo Yoga Book 9i is a dual-screen laptop that can fold and flip into several different modes. A Bluetooth keyboard, mouse, and stylus come with it, along with a keyboard folio that can transform into a laptop stand. It’s the Swiss Army knife of laptops. Read our head-to-head review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1999.99 $1499.99 at Best Buy\n\nA dual-screen laptop is admittedly pretty niche, but we chose Lenovo’s Yoga Book 9i is the best of the bunch in our best laptops guide. It runs on Intel’s Core Ultra 7 155U processor, and comes with 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and integrated Intel UHD graphics chip. Its key feature is the pair of 13.3-inch 60Hz OLED touchscreen displays, which each have a 2880 x 1800 resolution. The screens have a clamshell design and are attached by a hinge, so the Yoga Book 9i looks like a typical laptop when opened.\nYou can use the laptop in a few configurations. In clamshell mode, the bottom screen displays a full-sized virtual keyboard with trackpad to give you a traditional laptop experience. Our experience in this mode was mixed because it’s too easy to accidentally minimize apps, or make typos if you’re used to the tactile feel of a physical keyboard. \nYou can attach the Yoga Book 9i to the included keyboard folio, which props it up and allows you to use both screens independently like a laptop attached to an external monitor (except, in the Yoga Book 9i’s case, they’re built-in). One screen can be folded completely over the other display to use the laptop like a large-screen tablet, or folded partially to prop one screen up if you want to watch a movie at a more comfortable angle. \nDuring our testing, the Yoga Book 9i was difficult to use on a lap with the included Bluetooth keyboard because it would shift around while being used. However, moving apps from one display to another using touch gestures was intuitive thanks to tutorials in the User Center app, which immediately launch upon the first boot. The software also lets you enable and disable gestures, if you find some confusing or unnecessary. Switching from a traditional laptop to a dual-screen model will likely take an adjustment period, so it’s very helpful that Lenovo designed software to help ease you through the transition.\nDespite having two screens, the Yoga Book 9i only weighs 2.95 pounds, which was light enough to carry in a backpack without weighing us down. The keyboard folio adds some bulk, but comes with an attached elastic band to keep the laptop and accessory from getting detached while you travel. If you’re dedicated to the dual-screen lifestyle, or you want to give it a try, the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i is on sale for $1499.99 ($500 off) at Best Buy.\nUpdate, September 5th: Updated pricing and availability, and added a deal for Lenovo’s Yoga Book 9i (2024), as well as one for the Asus Zenbook S 16 that expires on September 7th.",

      "raw": "The Nintendo Switch 2 is here, but we’re not going to forget about the original Switch. We’ve still got love for the console and its many millions of owners, so we’ll keep recommending the best controllers for the Switch right here. If you’re considering getting a Switch 2 in the future, all of the controllers below will work on the newer console.\nNow, you may have already realized long ago that the best Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with the console. The removable Joy-Cons included with all non-Lite Switch consoles are convenient, given they can be detached for wireless use for up to two players with a pair, but their tiny shape doesn’t do them many favors. They aren’t comfortable to hold for long gaming sessions — especially if you have large hands. And, you’re definitely not alone if you’ve experienced Joy-Con drift.\nIn this buying guide, we’ll focus on wireless controllers that are both comfortable and reliable, as well as a few options that come with unique features designed that may match your unique play style. We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock here, as they’re mostly similar to each other and the savings aren’t worth giving up wireless freedom for.\nThere are some things that are worth knowing if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), it may not support HD rumble, motion controls, NFC for Amiibo, or be able to wake the Switch remotely. However, there are some exceptions, which we feature below.\nIf you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the official Nintendo Switch Pro Controller (even though its recent $10 price increase hurts). It’s one of very few gamepads to include every feature mentioned above, and it’s one of the most satisfying controllers to use that we’ve tested. The GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and Max, meanwhile, offer more exhaustive customization, while the Hori Split Pad Compact is a Joy-Con upgrade for those who prefer to play in handheld mode. Then there’s 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller and DualShock-esque Pro 3 controller, both of which are worth checking out.\nFeatured in this article\nBest for TV mode: Nintendo Switch Pro Controller\nThe Switch Pro Controller remains tough to beat, even to this day. It offers an unmatched set of features — including motion controls, NFC, and HD rumble — and is one of the most comfy gamepads available.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $79.99 at GameStop\n $79.99 at Best Buy\n $79.99 at Target\n\nBest for handheld mode: Hori Split Pad Compact\nMuch like the Split Pad Pro, the Compact version is bigger than the standard Joy-Con, making the Switch more comfortable to hold. The Compact, however, is smaller and more colorful.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $49.99 $45.99 at Amazon\n $49.99 at Hori\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode\nThe best Switch controller for handheld mode\nThe best Xbox-style controller for the Switch\nThe best Switch controller that’s also great for PC and Steam Deck\nA well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock\nAn adapter that lets you use your own controllers\nOther Switch controllers we tested\nWhat’s coming next?\n\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode\nNintendo Switch Pro Controller\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHigh quality, sturdy build\nSupports HD rumble, gyro motion, and NFC\nLong battery life\nMobile and PC compatibility\n\nOn the pricier side\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $79.99 at GameStop\n $79.99 at Best Buy\n $79.99 at Target\n\nSupported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes, HD / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes (but not the Switch 2)\nEver since the Switch launched, Nintendo’s first-party Pro controller has been the best gamepad for the console. In many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality. And, it’s compatible with the Switch 2 (although it can’t wake the new console from sleep — you’ll need a Switch 2 Pro Controller for that).\nAside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is one of an elite few wireless options that includes good rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s also one of a few controllers we’ve tested that can remotely turn on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.\nThe buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, aside from Xbox and PlayStation.\nGiven the high price — which went up another $10 when Nintendo recently increased Switch prices  — we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t possible. If you really want the ability to listen via wired headphones without connecting your controller with a wire, you’ll need to get the Switch 2 and its Switch 2 Pro controller.\nThe best Switch controller for handheld mode\nHori Split Pad Compact (Pokémon Gengar)\nHori’s Joy-Con alternatives offer a roomier, comfier grip for your Nintendo Switch in handheld mode without the added bulk of its Split Pad Pro version. They also feature two customizable rear buttons and are offered in multiple colors and designs but do not support rumble or Amiibo figures.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 at Amazon\n $59.99 at Walmart\n $49.99 at Hori (plain blue)\n\nSupported Platforms: Switch, Switch OLED / Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: Joy-Con slots / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: No / NFC: No / Motion: No / Power: via Joy-Con slots / Console Wakeup: No\nI’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re very comfortable. If you struggle with hand pain when you use the Switch, that’s where the Hori Split Pad Compact can help out.\nThe Split Pad Compact is a — you guessed it — a more compact alternative to the Split Pad Pro, which has unfortunately become tougher to find. Similarly, it comes in a variety of colorways, and it adds comfort to using the Switch in handheld mode. One half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides more grip than Joy-Con do, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast-paced gameplay, or to stay comfy over longer play sessions.\nThe Split Pad Compact doesn’t have batteries or sensors — or support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC — so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the Split Pad Compact Attachment that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment usually (but not always) costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t add any of the aforementioned features. It does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however.\nRead our Hori Split Pad Compact impressions.\nThe best Xbox-style controller for the Switch\nGuliKit KingKong 3\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat ergonomics with Xbox-style shape\nDeep customization options\nHall effect sticks and triggers\nSupports HD rumble, NFC, and motion\nWide platform compatibility\n\nLacks companion app for customizations\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 $44.99 at Amazon (Pro, save 10% at checkout)\n $79.99 $71.99 at Amazon (Max, save 10% at checkout)\n\nSupported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: Yes (only in KK3 Max) / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes\nOn the surface, the GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and KingKong 3 Max are similar to the last-gen models they replaced, which took design cues from Microsoft’s standard Xbox controller but rivaled the Switch Pro Controller in terms of build quality and features. We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K.\nBut there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB LED-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as iFixit explains here. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).\nAdditionally, both controllers feature detachable rear-facing paddles. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on the Xbox Elite Series 2 and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they won’t easily dislodge. \nThe longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros.\nIn summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offer a lot for the money. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of its settings more easily.\nThe best Switch controller that’s also great for PC and Steam Deck\n8Bitdo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller\nFor something cheaper — and in some ways better — than Nintendo’s official Pro controller, there’s 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2, which works with the original Switch and Switch 2. It features TMR joysticks with trigger switches for adjusting the feel, as well as vibration and motion control support.\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nErgonomically similar to the Switch Pro controller\nUses durable TMR sticks\nWirelessly compatible with mobile and PC\nShake to wake Switch\n\nLacks NFC\nRumble feels lousy\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 $62.99 at Amazon (black, with coupon)\n $69.99 $59.99 at Amazon (white)\n\nSupported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Android, macOS, Apple devices / Connectivity: 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable buttons: Yes, four / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes, but not Switch 2\n8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller is a minor step forward compared to the first iteration, but it comes with new features you might care about. It still feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. As for what’s changed internally, you’re getting more durable TMR joysticks, plus two new mappable buttons near the triggers (totaling four customizable buttons). Speaking of the triggers, they’re adjustable thanks to new switches that can alter how much you have to pull them to register an input. It’s particularly great for first-person shooters or action games where speed is paramount. \nIts haptics are decent in some games, but not nearly as good as Nintendo’s HD Rumble, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake. It’s a nice value compared to the Switch Pro, as well as most other third-party options because it also includes a charging dock with an integrated 2.4GHz transmitter.\nThe Ultimate 2 controller comes in two variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model for Switch owners because it’s the only version that’s compatible. Additionally, it’s compatible with the Switch 2, the Steam Deck, PC, macOS computers, and a slew of other Bluetooth-ready devices. Plus, it includes both 2.4GHz connectivity, in case you need a more reliable connection for compatible devices. \nAs for any control scheme tweaks you may want to make, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software V2 app on PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for great third-party controllers, and this is one of its best.\nA well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock\n8BitDo Pro 3 controller\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nIncludes charging dock and 2.4GHz dongle\nHighly customizable\nParticularly comfortable for small-handed gamers\n\nRumble isn’t great\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 $63 at Amazon (via on-page coupon)\n $69.99 at 8BitDo\n\nSupported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, and more / Connectivity: Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable buttons: Yes, four / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes, but not Switch 2\nThe 8BitDo Pro 3 is the company’s latest high-end controller. On its face, the biggest difference between it and the similarly-priced Ultimate 2 is its PlayStation DualShock-esque stick layout, which alone might enough to convince some gamers to get it. The Pro 3 improves on its predecessor by featuring swappable buttons that can be detached with its included magnetic suction tool. With it, you can go from the Nintendo layout to the Xbox layout. Otherwise, this model’s internal specs and compatibility are very similar to that of the Ultimate 2. \nThe Pro 3 features TMR joysticks, plus Hall effect triggers with switches that toggle between full pulls or shorter clicks for either trigger. Just like the Ultimate 2, the Pro 3 has four customizable buttons that can be assigned almost any other button, or combination of buttons, through the company’s Ultimate V2 app on PC or by pressing certain buttons together, as listed in the manual. Additionally, the controller supports turbo mode.\nCompared to most other Switch controllers, the Pro 3 stands out due to its PlayStation-style layout of D-pad and sticks. You may prefer this model if you play a lot of retro games that prioritize the D-pad, which is more easily accessible than on most other Switch controllers. One other fun perk of the Pro 3 is its swappable joystick caps. Two arcade stick-like knobs are included that make certain games feel more rewarding to play, such as fighting games.\nIt has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Overwatch 2, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming. \nOn its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, and DirectInput, each of which offers its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. One new addition for the Pro 3 is a charging dock that lets the controller recharge via contact pins. The dock also contains a 2.4GHz USB-C transmitter, letting you connect to some devices that route instead of Bluetooth. \nRead our 8BitDo Pro 3 review.\nAn adapter that lets you use your own controllers\n8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nInexpensive\nAllows you to use nearly any Bluetooth controller\n\nRequires sourcing your own controller\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $19.99 $16.99 at Amazon\n $19.99 $17.99 at 8BitDo\n $19.99 $16.99 at Best Buy\n\nThere are a few other devices that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s is the best value. Instead of spending $70 on a Switch Pro controller, the $19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2 lets you turn most Bluetooth controllers you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock (or directly into the console if you have a USB-A to USB-C adapter) and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model we’ve linked to.)\nTo our delight, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app. \n8BitDo has an extensive support page that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.\nIf you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (and a USB hub), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.\nOther Switch controllers we tested\nNitro Deck / Nitro Deck Plus\nWe like CRKD’s Nitro Deck around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up Nitro Deck Plus adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).\nGameSir T4 Cyclone Pro\nWe recently tested the GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro ($49.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the GuliKit KingKong 3 — including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit doesn’t match. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.\nPowerA GameCube Style Wireless Controller\nWe also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the GameCube Style Wireless Controller ($59.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard PowerA Enhanced Wireless ($44.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure Super Smash Bros. experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.\nWhat’s coming next?\nWe’ll be doing more testing on the EasySMX S10 controller, as well as the GameSir Super Nova and GuliKit’s Elves 2 and ES Pro controllers for consideration.\nUpdate, September 5th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability. Nintendo’s Switch Pro controller went up $10, as part of the company’s recent price increases on last-gen hardware and accessories.",

Home to the Giorgio Armani headquarters since 2000, the sprawling space includes a purpose-built theatre where each show season a catwalk is constructed.\nOn Friday, crowds again began to gather outside, but this time the mood was much more sombre. They had come to pay their final respects to the visionary Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani, who died on Thursday at the age of 91.\n Continue reading...",

      "raw": "If you want to stay alert while running or biking, the Nothing Ear Open are a worthwhile alternative to classic in-ear cans. That’s because the company’s first pair of open-style earbuds — which are now on sale at Nothing’s online storefront or Amazon for an all-time low $99 ($50 off) with a Prime membership — let you listen to music and podcasts while keeping tabs on traffic, pedestrians, and other potential hazards.\nNothing Ear Open\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $149 $99 at Amazon (with Prime)\n $149 $99 at Nothing\n\nNothing’s water-resistant earbuds use an over-the-ear hook to help them sit firmly in place, allowing them to securely rest just inside your ear instead of directly within the canal like a traditional pair of in-ears. Overall, they deliver solid audio quality thanks to a robust set of EQ options, and while bass performance can’t match that of modern in-ear models, their unique design helps reduce sound leakage. Each bud also comes with a pair of microphones and noise-canceling tech, so your calls come through clearer and less muddled.\nIn terms of battery life, the Ear Open charge via USB-C and deliver up to eight hours of playback, which is relatively good given their larger 14.2-millimeter drivers. They also support multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, allowing you to connect to two devices simultaneously, and offer a “Low Lag Mode” for gaming via Nothing’s companion app. And, if you’re a Nothing Phone owner, you get some nice extras, including ChatGPT integration.\nThree more deals worth a look\nIf you’re looking for an alternative to Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller, the GuliKit ES Pro is on sale at Amazon for an all-time low of $25.49 (about $5 off). You can use the wireless gamepad to wake the Switch 2—  a rare feature for a third-party controller — but it also works with both Windows and Android devices. It features anti-drift TMR joysticks, too, along with adjustable sensitivity settings and a swappable button layout for PC and Switch. Plus, its D-pad can toggle between four and eight-direction modes.\nYou can grab a copy of Assassin’s Creed Shadows for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X for $49.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, which matches its best price to date. Our reviewer Ash Parris isn’t usually into open-world games, but the latest title from Ubisoft won her over with its engaging characters, strong story, and stunning visuals of feudal Japan. This limited edition copy comes with both the game and some minor DLC, specifically extra weapons and gear for one of the game’s main protagonists. Read our review.\nYou can currently buy Epicka’s Universal Travel Adapter at Amazon in multiple colors for $17.99 ($5 off), which is its best price to date. The versatile adapter comes with four plug types, so you can use it in over 200 countries, including the UK, Japan, Italy, and more. It offers four USB-A ports, a single USB-C port, and one AC socket, letting you charge six devices simultaneously.",

The renders, shared with Android Headlines by reliable leaker OnLeaks, show a device with slim bezels and a prominent rear camera bar housing a pair of lenses.\nBased on the renders, the Galaxy S26 Edge may look much different than the Galaxy S25 Edge, which features three vertically-aligned rear cameras on the left side of the device. Instead, the Galaxy S26 Edge renders more closely resemble what appear to be iPhone 17 Pro leaks and dummy models spotted on the IFA 2025 showfloor. The difference is that the iPhone 17 Pro is rumored to come with three cameras on the back, not just two.\nThe Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to take the place of the S26 Plus and may also feature built-in magnets for Qi2 charging, bringing it in line with newer iPhones and the entire Pixel 10 lineup. Additionally, Android Headlines claims that the Galaxy S26 Edge will be even thinner than its predecessor, measuring 5.5mm thick (or 10.8mm with the camera bump), as opposed to 5.8mm with the S25 Edge.\nWe’ll likely have to wait until January to see if Samsung adopts the boxy camera island shown in the renders — but in just a few days, we’ll find out if Apple beats it to the punch.",
