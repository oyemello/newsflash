      "raw": "The Bounce 2 introduces a new round design with an upgraded AMOLED screen. | Image: Garmin\t\n\nGarmin announced a new version of its Bounce smartwatch for kids that first debuted in 2022 with tracking and communication features powered by an LTE connection. The Bounce 2 introduces a new design and upgrades that include two-way talking instead of just voice messaging. It looks less like a kids watch now, but the limited upgrades may not be enough to justify a price jump from $149.99 to $299.99 for the new mode,l which is now available through Garmin.\nThe original Bounce featured a square design (which potentially appealed to some kids with Apple Watch envy) and an LCD screen, while the new Bounce 2 is round with a more vivid 1.2-inch AMOLED display. Text messaging is still an option but the Bounce 2 has improved voice messages with a new feature that will transcribe them so they can be read or listened to.\nThe Bounce 2 carries forward real-time location tracking through the Garmin Jr. app and still lets parents opt for alerts when kids leave a designated area using temporary geofencing. Battery life stays the same at up to two days between charges, but a new feature that lets kids download and listen to songs from Amazon Music could reduce that. Although the watch itself has doubled in price, LTE connectivity is still $9.99 per month or $99.99 annually with one of Garmin’s Kids Smartwatch Plans.",

These young patients have witnessed horrors no child should ever see, but this marks the start of their journey towards recovery.\nIn Gaza, where the healthcare system has been decimated and hospitals are no longer functioning, there are severely ill children unable to get the medical care they need to survive.\nAs we welcome the first group of children to the UK for urgent treatment, their arrival reflects our determined commitment to humanitarian action and the power of international cooperation.\n Continue reading...",

      "raw": "The Wacom One 14 features a bigger display with smaller bezels.\t\n\nWacom has introduced a new 14-inch creative display tablet to its entry-level product line for students and hobbyists. The Wacom One 14 is a smidge larger than the One 12 and One 13 touch pen display tablets that Wacom launched in 2023, providing a bigger digital canvas for users to sketch, edit photos, and sculpt 3D models while still being compact and light enough to toss into a backpack.\nIt’s available to buy today for $299.95. That’s significantly less than the $400 launch price for the smaller Wacom One 12 (which has since dropped to $210 on Wacom’s website), and unlike the smaller model, the Wacom One 14 comes with a battery-free Wacom One Standard Pen stylus and USB-C cable included in the box. It’s thinner and the bezels around the display have been slimmed down, but otherwise, its design is similar to the smaller models. It needs to be connected to a laptop or computer to work, and supports Windows, Mac, and Chromebook devices.\n\nThe Wacom One 14 features an IPS display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. It’s nothing fancy — lacking support for Wacom’s 10-finger multitouch gestures, for example — but that’s the point. The target demographic for this tablet is people looking to buy their first artist display tablet, or those who don’t need all the professional features and higher resolutions provided by Wacom’s more expensive Cintiq range. That $300 price can also help Wacom to better compete against more affordable offerings from competing tablet providers like Huion, XP-Pen, and Gaomon.",

The policy makes the outlet one of the first to formally allow such extensive use of the technology.\nThe AI guidelines were reportedly circulated in an internal memo from editor-in-chief Jamie Heller on Thursday. The policy authorized journalists to deploy AI “like any other tool” for tasks like research and image editing, Status reported.\nA dedicated FAQ reportedly addressed whether journalists can explicitly use AI to assist with writing first drafts. “Yes, but you must make sure your final work is yours,” it answered. The guidelines stressed final products must be the journalist’s own work, however, adding that journalists would be responsible for stories under their name. \nDisclaimers warning audiences AI has been used will probably not accompany articles, Status said, though disclaimers would be attached to entirely AI-generated or unvetted content.\nAI has divided the news industry, undermining business models, sparking allegations of theft by AI companies, and creating new risks for publishers, something Business Insider knows firsthand after publishing AI-generated stories by a supposed freelancer this summer.\nBusiness Insider has been quick to embrace AI in support of its business. It appointed an AI newsroom lead and implemented an array of initiatives like an AI search tool, for example, and parent company Axel Springer inked licensing deals with tech companies like OpenAI and Microsoft.",

      "raw": "Consumer Reports is calling on Microsoft to extend the October 14th deadline that will cut off free security updates for Windows 10 computers. In a letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Consumer Reports says the move will “strand millions of consumers” who have machines incompatible with Windows 11.\nAs noted by Consumer Reports, data suggests that around 46.2 percent of people around the world still use Windows 10 as of August 2025, while around 200 to 400 million PCs can’t be upgraded to Windows 11 due to missing hardware requirements.\nIn the letter, Consumer Reports calls Microsoft “hypocritical” for urging customers to upgrade to Windows 11 to bolster cybersecurity, but then leaving Windows 10 devices susceptible to cyberattacks. It also calls out the $30 fee Microsoft charges customers for “a mere one-year extension to preserve their machine’s security,” as well as the free support options that force people to use Microsoft products, allowing the company to “eke out a bit of market share over competitors.”\nConsumer Reports asks that Microsoft continue providing support for Windows 10 computers for free until more people have upgraded to Windows 11. A Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) has also petitioned for an extended deadline, saying “as many as 400 million perfectly good computers that can’t upgrade to Windows 11 will be thrown out.”",

      "raw": "Microsoft’s former store in London. | Photo: Getty Images\t\n\nMicrosoft is announcing that it’s investing £22 billion (around $30 billion) in the UK to help support AI infrastructure and ongoing operations from 2025 through 2028. The investment includes $15 billion in capital expenditures to build a supercomputer to support AI demand and adoption.\n“This will account for more than two-thirds of the tech sector’s total investment announcements in the UK that are being made this week,” says Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith in a press briefing attended by The Verge. “We’re focused on British pounds, not empty tech promises, because it’s easy to have big numbers, but we’ll be good for every cent of this investment.”\nSmith is clearly referencing Google’s own investment of £5 billion (around $6.8 billion) that it announced earlier today to help power the UK’s AI efforts. Smith says Microsoft’s latest UK investment is a “very substantial increase” over its previous investment in 2023.\n“This investment will enable us to build the country’s largest supercomputer — with more than 23,000 advanced GPUs — in partnership with Nscale,” says Smith. “We’re not just investing in the UK, we’re investing with partners in the UK. It includes the data centers we have today and an expansion of them.”\nMicrosoft’s multibillion-dollar investments in the UK come on the same day President Donald Trump arrives in Britain for a second state visit, in what’s meant to be seen as a clear collaboration between the US and UK. Smith told reporters that the investment wasn’t requested by the Trump administration, but it’s clearly been well timed on the UK government side.\n\nThe announcement is a big change from Microsoft’s issues with the UK only a few years ago. Smith openly criticized the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) during Microsoft’s giant Activision Blizzard acquisition in 2023. Smith said his confidence in the UK had been “severely shaken” after the CMA originally blocked Microsoft’s giant gaming deal, and even said “the European Union is a more attractive place to start a business” than the UK. Smith later described the regulator as “tough and fair” last year, and said he “might choose slightly different words” to make his point about the CMA.\nSmith praised both former Prime Minster Rishi Sunak’s and Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s governments during his briefing with reporters today. “Our ability to make an investment of this size is based in no small measure on the work the government is doing to reform planning, grow electricity capacity, and foster a more stable and open regulatory environment,” says Smith.\nGoogle is also opening a new data center in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, that Chancellor Rachel Reeves calls a “powerful vote of confidence in the UK economy and the strength of our partnership with the US.” Microsoft managed to one-up Google and get Starmer to comment on its own investment, and he also called it “a powerful vote of confidence in UK’s leadership in AI and cutting-edge technology.”\nThe other half of Microsoft’s $30 billion investment will be used to support the company’s ongoing operations across the UK, including its 6,000 employees that are based in Britain. Microsoft did close its 21,000-square-foot store in the heart of London earlier this year, but the company still holds offices at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, the Microsoft UK headquarters in Reading, Microsoft AI in London, and elsewhere.",

Under the agreement, Waymo will roll out its service to SFO in three phases, including testing vehicles with a human driver, testing without a driver, and eventually beginning commercial service. \nWaymo will start its tests with employees before eventually inviting members of the public to take trips to and from the airport. Pickups and dropoffs will initially take place at SFO’s Kiss & Fly lot, which is accessible to the terminals via the AirTrain. \nWaymo operates in five cities, but currently only serves one airport: Phoenix’s Sky Harbor. The company has been locked in negotiations with SFO for several years as it seeks to assure regulators that its vehicles can handle their chaotic environments, with thousands of cars, taxis, shuttles, and passengers constantly intermixing everyday. \nBut airports represent a huge money-making opportunity for robotaxis, with airport trips accounting for an estimated 20 percent of human-driven ridehail car trips.

      "raw": "The Palm Lock’s infrared sensor identifies users through the veins in their hands. | Image: Wyze\t\n\nWyze has announced its first smart door lock that can be opened by simply hovering your open hand over it. The Wyze Palm Lock is launching today for $129.98 making it more affordable than similar palm-scanning smart locks including the $359.99 Philips Smart Deadbolt that launched last year. But your palm isn’t the only way to unlock it. If it’s the dead of winter and you’re wearing gloves the Palm Lock can also be opened using a physical key, by punching in a code, or using Wyze’s mobile app.\nIt’s not as cheap as Wyze’s $80 Wyze Lock Bolt that we called the “Best budget smart(ish) lock” in our buying guide, but the Palm Lock includes more functionality. Battery life is rated at up to six months thanks to the use of low-power millimeter wave radar that only wakes the lock when a person is detected nearby. Its primary battery can be removed so you can recharge it indoors, while a smaller secondary battery will keep the lock powered for up to two weeks. Should both batteries die, an external power source can be temporarily connected to a USB-C port allowing it to be unlocked using an access code.\nPalm vein recognition has been shown to be a more secure and accurate method of biometric security than fingerprint readers, and simply waving your hand over an infrared sensor requires less precision than scanning a fingerprint. The Wyze Palm Lock can store palm vein IDs for up to 50 users, and generate up to 50 unique entry codes giving access to people whose palms haven’t been registered.\nWyze’s Palm Lock is Wi-Fi connected so it can also be locked and unlocked from anywhere your phone has internet access or using voice commands through smart assistants like Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant. For added security, the lock incorporates a gyroscope that detects the door’s angle and movements. It can be set to automatically lock the door when it senses it’s been closed all the way, or start audibly chirping after a set period of time if it detects the door has been left open.",
