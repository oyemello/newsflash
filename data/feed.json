      "raw": "The aptly-named Max Headphones Charging Stand is specifically designed for Apple’s flagship headphones. | Image: Mophie\t\n\nMophie has announced a new wireless charger for Apple’s AirPods Max called the Max Headphones Charging Stand. The AirPods Max don’t support wireless charging, so Mophie’s new stand relies on a small dongle that stays connected to the headphones’ USB-C port at all times. When docked in the stand, the dongle magnetically aligns and connects to charging pins that deliver power to the battery while additional magnets in the cradle put the headphones into sleep mode.\nThe Max Headphones Charging Stand is available now through Mophie’s online store for $150, and includes a dongle compatible with the USB-C version of the AirPods Max that Apple introduced a year ago. The company currently has no plans to introduce a Lightning connector version of the dongle that would make the stand compatible with older versions of the AirPods Max.\nThe stand features a weighted base made from anodized aluminum, while the cradle that supports the AirPods Max earcups is made from soft-touch silicone so it won’t scratch the headphones’ finish.\nAlthough it’s a more convenient way to keep the AirPods Max charged when not in use (they only go into their battery-saving sleep mode when placed in their case) the stand is another accessory demanding precious desktop real estate. To help further justify the splurge, Mophie includes a second Qi-compatible pad on the base for wirelessly charging your AirPods earbuds or a smartphone, but there’s no mention of Qi2.2 or even Qi2 support, so don’t expect fast charging speeds or the convenience of magnets there.",

      "raw": "Roblox is going to start showing ESRB ratings alongside experiences to help users in the US better understand if an experience is appropriate for a user of a certain age. The new ratings will appear thanks to Roblox’s new partnership with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC), which was announced today.\nAs part of the partnership, players in other countries will see age ratings from the ratings agency for their region. Right now, Roblox uses its own “content maturity labels” to indicate maturity level of experiences, but these will be replaced with ratings from the agencies in the future.\n“With so many families engaging with Roblox, it is hugely beneficial to provide parents with trusted and familiar ratings no matter where they live,” Patricia Vance, president of the ESRB and chairperson of IARC, says in a statement. “The globally streamlined process will provide Roblox creators with an efficient and proven process for obtaining age and content ratings, while informing parents of what their kids may experience before they play.”\nRoblox also announced a plan to, by the end of the year, require all users who use any of its communication features to have their age estimated by the platform. Right now, users older than 9 can communicate via Roblox’s in-game, filtered chat without going through the age estimation process. The age estimation will rely on “a combination of facial age estimation technology, ID age verification, and verified parental consent,” Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman says in a blog post.\nThe platform has come under significant scrutiny over its child safety practices, with the state of Louisiana suing Roblox in August for allegedly creating an environment where “child predators thrive.” These new child safety features announced today build on other recent changes like Roblox locking down sexual content and adding improved parental controls.",

      "raw": "After years of requests from users, Instagram will finally have a dedicated app for iPad. Beginning Wednesday, September 3rd, users will be able to download the new app built specifically for Apple’s tablet. But it will be slightly different than the mobile app users are accustomed to.\nMost significantly, the iPad app will open directly to a feed of Reels, the company’s TikTok competitor — perhaps a sign of the short-form-video times. Back in April, reporting indicated that Meta was working on an iPad app for Instagram after years of dragging its feet, in part prompted by the legally and politically iffy spot TikTok found itself in. For years, Instagram for iPad was something to tackle “at some point” — until its biggest competitor was facing what would effectively be a ban in the US. From this perspective, opening the app straight to Reels makes perfect sense.\nOther features will be available on iPad: Stories will still line the top of the homepage, and users will be able to switch to a “Following” tab where they’ll be able to swipe between feeds that more resemble the mobile Instagram experience (including a chronological option). The bigger screen means more space and fewer clicks: comments on Reels will appear next to full-size videos, and the DMs page will have your inbox alongside chats, similar to what Messenger looks like on desktop.\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri has said in the past that the group of people wanting an iPad app just wasn’t big enough for it to be a top priority. So what’s changed in the last few years? Perhaps the number of kids using tablets has changed the calculus, or TikTok’s regulatory vulnerability bumped this up on the to-do list. One thing that’s obvious from this is that Instagram is not letting up on Reels: it’s extended the length of clips, added the ability to repost and fast-forward them, and earlier this year was trying to recruit popular TikTokers. The company sees a future for Instagram on tablets — and it’s short-form video all the way down.",

      "raw": "When it comes to finding a device to read ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on X or Bluesky. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.\n \n\nThe best Kindle (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition deals\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Kids deals\n\nAmazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the Kindle Scribe, Amazon is moving beyond books and into the realm of writing — something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.\nBelow, we’ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes there isn’t a deal for one or even any of the products, but in those cases, we’ve listed the most recent sale price. \nThe best Kindle (2024) deals\nWhat does it mean when a Kindle is “ad-supported”?\nAmazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.\nIn case you missed it, Amazon announced a new entry-level Kindle in October of last year, one that was designed to replace the outgoing 2022 model. The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.\nIn the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, however, you can only buy the base Kindle at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its full retail price of $109.99.\nKindle (2024)\nAmazon’s most recent entry-level Kindle features a 6-inch, 300ppi display, support for USB-C charging, and up to six weeks of battery life. It’s also brighter than previous models and offers noticeably faster performance.\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $109.99 at Amazon\n $109.99 at Best Buy\n $109.99 at Target\n\nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\nAmazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The new Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.\nIn terms of add-ons, the newest Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The last feature is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series — at no additional cost.\nPreviously, we’ve seen the latest Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off). Right now, however, you can only pick it up at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target at its full price of $129.99.\nKindle Kids (2024)\nAmazon’s Kindle Kids is identical to the standard Kindle — meaning it packs a 300ppi display and support for USB-C charging — but comes with a case, an extended two-year warranty, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129.99 at Amazon\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n $129.99 at Target\n\n\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\nThe latest Kindle Paperwhite, which launched last year, is Amazon’s 12th-gen model. Considering it’s one of the company’s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. It’s noticeably faster than Amazon’s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life.\nDuring events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we’ve seen the standard Paperwhite drop to as low as $129.99. Sadly, the standalone model is currently only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $159.99 (its full retail price). If you’re okay with purchasing a bundle, you can grab it at Amazon with a power adapter and either a green, pink, or black fabric cover for $196.97 ($20 off); it’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in green, pink, or black for $202.97 (also $20 off).\nRead our Kindle Paperwhite (2024) review.\nKindle Paperwhite (2024)\nAmazon’s latest Paperwhite features a larger seven-inch display and noticeably faster performance. It also boasts longer battery life than the previous model, retains IPX8 waterproofing, and includes a USB-C port. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159.99 at Amazon (ad-supported)\n $159.99 at Best Buy (ad-supported)\n $159.99 at Target (ad-supported)\n\n\n2024 Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle (with ads)\nThe seven-inch Kindle Paperwhite features a larger display and faster performance than Amazon’s entry-level ebook reader. You can also buy it in a bundle with a cover and a USB-C charger. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $216.97 $196.97 at Amazon (fabric cover)\n $222.97 $202.97 at Amazon (leather cover)\n\nLike other Kindles, the new Paperwhite is available in a few different configurations — including an ad-free Signature Edition that’s identical to the standard model but comes with 32GB of storage, Qi wireless charging, and a backlight that will automatically adjust when needed. \nIn the past, the Signature Edition has been discounted to $149.99 ($50 off). Currently, however, it is only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its usual price of $199.99. You can also pick it up at Amazon with a wireless charging dock and a black, green, or pink fabric cover starting at $251.97 ($25 off). It’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in black, green, or pink for $257.97 ($25 off).\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (2024)\nThe premium Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition offers the same design and performance as the standard model but with more storage and support for wireless charging.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $199.99 at Amazon\n $199.99 at Best Buy \n $199.99 at Target\n\n\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition Essentials Bundle\nAmazon’s step-up Kindle Paperwhite bundle includes a Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, a wireless charging dock, and your choice of either a fabric or plant-based cover.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $276.97 $251.97 at Amazon (fabric cover)\n $282.97 $257.97 at Amazon (leather cover)\n\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals\nAmazon also rolled out a Kindle Paperwhite Kids for $179.99 in 2024. It’s identical to the standard Kindle Paperwhite, with the same waterproof design and sharp, seven-inch display. However, like the Kindle Kids, the e-reader is free of ads and offers optional parental controls. It also comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.\nAlthough the Kindle Paperwhite Kids has been known to occasionally drop to $129.99 ($50 off) during special sales events, it’s currently only available for its usual price of $179.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.\nKindle Paperwhite Kids (2024)\nAmazon’s kid-friendly Paperwhite is the same as the standard Paperwhite, but it’s ad-free and comes with the added benefits of a two-year hardware protection plan, six months of Amazon Kids Plus, and a choice of three kid-friendly covers. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 at Amazon\n $179.99 at Best Buy\n $179.99 at Target\n\n\nThe best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals\nLike its predecessor, the second-gen Kindle Scribe is Amazon’s biggest e-reader. It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300ppi resolution, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles are known. What separates the Scribe from other Kindles, however, is that it comes with a stylus, which can be used to jot down notes or doodle in the ebook reader’s built-in notebook. With the latest Scribe, Amazon also introduced a new Active Canvas feature, so you can scribble notes directly on ebook pages, as well as a suite of AI-powered features that can summarize your notes and refine your handwriting.\nAlthough we recently saw the standard Kindle Scribe go for an impressive $259.99 ($140 off), it’s currently only available for its usual $399.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. You can also pick up the base Scribe at Amazon as a part of a bundle with a 9W power adapter, a Premium Pen, and either a plant-based leather cover starting at $444.97 ($55 off) or a “premium” leather cover starting at $459.97 ($60 off). Alternatively, the 64GB version is available at Amazon with the same accessories and a premium leather cover for $504.97 ($65 off).\nRead our Kindle Scribe (2024) review.\nKindle Scribe (2024)\nThe latest Kindle Scribe is a 10.2-inch e-reader with a stylus for taking notes.

Like the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, it boasts a seven-inch display with a crisp 300ppi resolution, IPX8 water resistance, wireless charging, and 32GB of storage. However, unlike the Paperwhite, the e-reader offers a color mode, which cuts the resolution in half. Thankfully, it’s still vibrant for a color E-Ink screen despite the lower resolution, rendering it particularly ideal for reading comic books and manga.\nMore recently, Amazon introduced a cheaper Colorsoft, one that retails for $249.99 and comes with only 16GB of storage. It lacks wireless charging and an auto-adjusting front light, but it’s otherwise identical to the first-gen model. \nThe 16GB model has yet to receive a discount, and while the 32GB Signature Edition has gone on sale for as low as $179.99 (100 off) previously, it can now only be found at its usual $279.99 price at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. However, you can save some money at Amazon if you buy it as a part of a bundle for $327.97 ($53 off), which nets you a wireless charging dock and plant-based leather cover in black, pink, or green. If you want a more premium experience, Amazon even sells it with a leather cover in red or black for $349.97 ($35 off).\nRead our Kindle Colorsoft review.\nKindle Colorsoft Signature Edition\nThe Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is Amazon’s first e-reader with a color display. It also boasts 32GB of storage, waterproofing, and support for wireless charging.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $279.99 at Amazon\n $279.99 at Best Buy\n $279.99 at Target\n\n\nKindle Colorsoft Signature Edition Essentials Bundle\nThe Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is Amazon’s first color e-reader. It comes with wireless charging, IPX8 water resistance, and 32GB of storage. It retails for $279.99 by itself, but Amazon also sells it as part of a bundle that contains a wireless charging dock and one of two covers.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $362.97 $327.97 at Amazon (with plant-based cover)\n\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Kids deals\nLast month, Amazon announced a kid-friendly version of the Colorsoft with 16GB of storage and an MSRP of $269.99. Like the Signature Edition, the Kindle Colorsoft Kids offers a seven-inch color display and IPX8 water resistance, but it lacks wireless charging. The ad-free ebook reader also comes with one of two covers, a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids Plus, an extended two-year warranty, and optional parental controls.\nGiven how recently it launched, there are currently no deals available on the Colorsoft Kids; however, you can still buy it at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its full retail price of $269.99.\nKindle Colorsoft Kids\nLike the standard model, Amazon’s kid-friendly Colorsoft comes with a seven-inch color display and waterproofing. The 16GB e-reader also offers parental controls, a two-year warranty, a protective cover, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $269.99 $239.99 at Amazon\n $269.99 $239.99 at Best Buy\n $269.99 $239.99 at Target",

      "raw": "Google’s TV Streamer 4K is on sale for $79.99 ($20 off).\t\n\nIt’s rare to find a gadget that can handle two totally separate tasks very well, but Google’s TV Streamer 4K pulls it off. The 4K set top box allows you to stream your favorite TV shows and movies, and is also an impressive smart home hub, with support for Matter and a built-in Thread radio. It’s currently on sale for $79.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart, which is its lowest price since May, and a dollar shy of its lowest price to date.\nGoogle TV Streamer (4K)\nGoogle’s terrific TV Streamer (4K) is the company’s best attempt at a streaming device yet, with built-in ethernet, an excellent interface, and smart home compatibility with both Matter and Thread. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.99 $79.99 at Amazon\n $99.99 $79.99 at Walmart\n $99.99 $79.99 at Best Buy\n\nThe TV Streamer 4K is bigger than a streaming dongle like the Fire TV Stick, but won’t take up much room on top of your TV stand. It has a gigabit ethernet port for wired networking and a HDMI 2.1 port to send a 4K 60Hz signal to your TV or projector. It supports multiple HDR (High Dynamic Range) and surround sound audio formats, including Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. In our tests, the TV Streamer 4K took about 10 minutes to set up — including downloading and installing a software update — when using the Google Home app on a smartphone. The TV Streamer asks whether you’d like to set up a child’s profile during setup, which is helpful if you have kids. \nThe Google TV Streamer 4K runs on Android TV, which we found easy to navigate using buttons on the remote or our voice via the remote’s built-in mic and Google Assistant. Google Assistant recognized our voice requests, and took us directly to the shows we wanted to watch (most of the time). Android TV has apps for every major streaming service, and popping in and out of them constantly can get tedious, which is why it’s nice to have reliable on-board voice controls. \nIf you want a Google Home Hub to control your smart home gadgets, the TV Streamer 4K is a great choice. You can use it to connect smart lights, locks, and thermostats to Google Home, and once these devices are configured, you can control them from the TV Streamer 4K by using Google Assistant or navigating to a Home panel. It only took a few seconds to run a scene controlling multiple smart home devices simultaneously. If your TV’s built-in streaming apps are feeling sluggish, or you want to expand your smart home into the living room, the Google TV Streamer 4K is a great choice — especially now that it’s on sale. \nRead our Google TV Streamer review",
