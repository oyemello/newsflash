      "raw": "Some people like to stay on the cutting edge of technology. If that’s you, you already know that Google is going to officially unveil its Pixel 10 phones (including a new Fold) during its August 20th event. But if you’re someone who prefers to use these opportunities to save on last-gen tech, you’ve been rewarded with a sweet deal on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The base 256GB version in obsidian (black) is down to $1,199 at Amazon and Best Buy, which is 33 percent off its original $1,799 price. It was selling for $100 more just last week.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799 $1199 at Amazon (256GB)\n $1799 $1199 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $1799 at Google (256GB)\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold was a big leap forward compared to Google’s first-gen foldable, touting a lightweight design that looks and feels like a normal phone before you unfold it. One of its main drawbacks was that, despite its high original price, you don’t get the same great cameras in the cheaper Pixel 9 Pro (which, by the way, is only $599 at Best Buy). They’re still good, mind you, but reviewer Allison Johnson said during her testing that its telephoto lens produced softer images by comparison, and low-light photos were less detailed. Drawbacks aside, she was eager to recommend the foldable phone at its original $1,800 price.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is nearly upon us, and it’ll likely deliver some sizeable improvements. Google itself has already shown off its design in YouTube clips, and it’s very similar to the model on sale now. However, there’s a rumor that it might have an IP68 rating, which would make it dustproof. Dust was the kryptonite for early foldable models, but the tech has apparently come a long way since then, so this would be a huge selling point in favor of the new model if it’s true.\nRead our full Pixel 9 Pro Fold review.\nOther Verge-approved deals for your weekend\nWe had some tough (but warranted) words for the Windows version of the Lenovo Legion Go S gaming handheld in our review. The Verge’s Sean Hollister summed it up by saying it “feels good, plays bad,” which I echo in my Polygon review from earlier this year. One of Sean’s main complaints is the exorbitant $730 price that Lenovo was charging, especially since its specs aren’t all that impressive compared to the Steam Deck, and don’t get us started on the pain of using Windows 11 in handheld mode. However, its recent $300 off price drop at Best Buy to $499.99 makes it easier to overlook its faults. This model has AMD’s Ryzen Z2 Go chip, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It’s a decent value now considering that the version with SteamOS instead of Windows 11 costs $599.99, yet includes half the RAM and storage, though we’d still recommend picking a system with a Z1 Extreme chip. Also, note that Valve told us it doesn’t officially support SteamOS on the Windows model.\nIf you’re looking for your first — or next — Sonos speaker, there aren’t too many deals worth flagging on new units right now. One good refurbished deal has come to the surface, though, and it’s on the Sonos One SL, which is $119 at Wellbots for Verge readers. Enter the code SONOSVERGE40 at checkout to knock the price down from $159. This is an appealing deal because it beats the current prices at Sonos’ own refurbished outlet, and because it comes with a one-year warranty through Sonos — just as new speakers do. The 2019 One SL can be used alone, or synced up with other Sonos Wi-Fi speakers through the company’s app. It lacks a microphone, so you can’t bark voice commands at it. Read our Sonos One review.\nThose who own a 4K Blu-ray player, like the Panasonic DP-UB420-K, can add more flicks to their library of discs on the cheap over at Gruv. The shopping site (which is owned by Universal Pictures) is offering a bunch of 4K Blu-ray titles in a “3 for $30” sale, making each one just $10 before tax and shipping. Just to give you some examples of visually-stunning films that are eligible, there’s Dunkirk, Crazy Rich Asians, The Matrix Resurrections, and more.",

      "raw": "You can get a great budget device these days if you know how to pick your priorities. | Image: The Verge\t\n\nSome of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets. They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.\nBudget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever. You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world.\nWhat compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.\n\nThe best cheap iPhone\nThe best Android phone under $500\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nOther budget phones to consider\n\nThe best cheap iPhone\niPhone 16E\nThe iPhone 16E is the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, bringing flagship-level performance for less than the standard 16. We really wish it included MagSafe for $599, but those upgrading from older iPhones will probably be satisfied with what’s included.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nReliable performance\nGood, if limited, camera system\nIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy\n\nNo MagSafe\n$599 feels like $100 too much\nNo ultrawide\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 at Apple\n $599.99 at Best Buy\n $599.99 at Verizon\n\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nIf I were making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly cheap. If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.\nThere’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.\nAnother heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming and the most interesting bits won’t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.\nRead my full iPhone 16E review.\nThe best Android phone under $500\nGoogle Pixel 9A\nThe Pixel 9A adds more robust water resistance and a brighter, bigger screen to what was already a winning formula for a good midrange phone.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nRobust IP68 rating\nSeven years of software updates\nBrighter, bigger screen\n\nMissing a couple of AI features\nAI is occasionally handy, usually weird\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 $399 at Amazon\n $499 $399 at Best Buy\n $499.99 $399 at Google\n\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nGoogle’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right. \nThe phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also received a slight boost to IP68, which means it can withstand a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.\nThe 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A’s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin.\nRead my full Google Pixel 9A review.\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nOnePlus 13R\nThe OnePlus 13R is a pared-down version of the company’s flagship phone, and it offers excellent battery life and a great screen for the price.\n\n\nScore: 6\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent battery life\nGreat screen for the price\nSix years of security updates\n\nNo wireless charging\nOnly splash-resistant\nFewer OS updates than Google and Samsung\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599.99 $499.99 at Amazon\n $599.99 $499.99 at Best Buy\n $599.99 $499.99 at OnePlus\n\nScreen: 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP65\nThe OnePlus 13R isn’t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It’s also a little pricier at $599 — although we’ve seen it on sale for $499 for extended periods of time — but for some people, the 13R’s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best big screens in its class, and many people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you’re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.\nThere’s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won’t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against sprays and rain showers, but it isn’t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won’t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience, especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A.\nRead my full OnePlus 13R review.\nOther budget phones to consider\nThe 2025 Motorola Moto G Power offers a lot despite its starting price of $299.99. It features a 6.8-inch LCD display, a 5,000mAh battery, wireless charging support, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is increasingly rare in 2025. Additionally, the device combines both IP68 and IP69 ratings, meaning it’s rated for both submersion in water and exposure to high-pressure water jets and steam, in addition to full protection from dust.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is another perfectly capable phone that doesn’t quite earn a recommendation here. It’s a little outside the scope of this guide at $649 anyway, but you do get a telephoto lens and a nice, big screen for that price. Still, you’re better off saving a bunch and picking up the Pixel 9A or trying to score a trade-in promo for the newer Galaxy S25. Read our review.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A56 recently launched in the US with a starting price of $499. The device has all the makings of a solid midrange phone, including a 6.7-inch OLED display, a 50-megapixel main camera, an Exynos 1580 chip, and a 5,000mAh battery with 45W wired charging. Although we haven’t tested it yet, it has some pretty stiff competition in the form of the Pixel 9A, which also has a starting price of $499.\nWe got our first glimpse of the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G back at CES 2025, and it’s finally in our hands for testing. The device features an Nxtpaper matte LCD screen that’s supposed to be easier on your eyes than a traditional LCD, as it reduces your exposure to blue light. It also features a “Max Ink Mode,” which turns the screen monochrome and silences notifications. This, in turn, can help extend the phone’s battery life to multiple days. Read our initial impressions.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A36 5G is another great choice that recently launched in the US for $399.99. The device sports a big OLED display, a decent midrange Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor, and an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance. Samsung is promising six years of OS and security updates, which is a lot in this price range. Compared to the Galaxy A35 5G, which we previously included in this guide but is no longer available, the A36 5G drops the microSD slot for a second SIM card slot. While we haven’t tested the A36 5G, its predecessor offered a good balance of hardware and price, and the latest release sounds just as compelling.\nUpdate, August 15th: Updated pricing / availability and added a bullet for the Galaxy A36 5G.

      "raw": "The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against Roblox, alleging that the company has “permitted and perpetuated an online environment in which child predators thrive, directly contributing to the widespread victimization of minor children in Louisiana.” \nRoblox sees more than 111.8 million daily active users, and it’s hugely popular with children, with users under 13 comprising nearly 40 percent of players last quarter. However, the platform has come under significant scrutiny over reported failures to protect children on the platform, with Bloomberg publishing a major report last year about predators on Roblox and the investment firm Hindenburg Research alleging that its research revealed “an X-rated pedophile hellscape.” In recent months, Roblox has taken steps to bolster its child safety features, including introducing parent accounts that can manage their child’s account and the ability for parents to block people on their child’s friend list.\nBut Louisiana alleges that Roblox’s “deliberate failure to implement effective safety measures to protect child users from well-documented predatory threats, along with its ongoing failure to warn parents and children of the foreseeable dangers posed by its platform, has directly facilitated the widespread sexual exploitation of minors and inflicted severe, lasting harm upon the children of Louisiana,” according to the complaint.\n“Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,” Attorney General Liz Murrill says. “Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.”\nRoblox spokesperson Kadia Koroma sent the following statement about the lawsuit to The Verge:\nThe assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is categorically untrue. Every day, tens of millions of people around the world use Roblox to learn stem skills, play, and imagine and have a safe experience on our platform. We dedicate vast resources to supporting a safe infrastructure including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior — not only because it’s important to us but because it is such a critical issue and so important to our community. We dispute these allegations and we remain committed to working with Attorney General Murrill to keep kids safe.\nWhile no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous safeguards—such as restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing—to help protect our community. Unfortunately, bad actors will try to circumvent our systems to try to direct users off the platform, where safety standards and moderation practices may differ. We continuously work to block those efforts and to enhance our moderation approaches to promote a safe and enjoyable environment for all users.\nThe company also published an article responding to the lawsuit on its newsroom.\nSeven lawsuits regarding child predator issues have been filed against Roblox in a “little over two weeks,” Bloomberg reports.\nThis week, Roblox published a post on its website about why it removes what it describes as “vigilantes” who try to catch bad actors on Roblox by using tactics “similar to actual predators.” One user, who goes by “Schlep” and says on his X profile that he has contributed to “6 Roblox arrests and counting,” posted screenshots on X last week of what he says was a cease-and-desist notice by Roblox.\nUpdate, August 15th: Added statement from Roblox.",

      "raw": "Apple’s latest AirPods Pro are receiving the biggest discount at 32 percent off. | Photo: Chris Welch / The Verge\t\n\nIf you know where to look, you can often score discounts on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. Both the newer AirPods Max and AirPods 4 (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the latest AirPods Pro with USB-C. Events like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday often bring the steepest discounts, though you can still find great deals throughout the year.\n \n\nThe best AirPods 4 deals\nThe best AirPods Pro (second-gen) deals\nThe best AirPods Max deals\n\nBelow, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the latest AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max.\nThe best AirPods 4 deals\nApple AirPods 4\nApple’s AirPods 4 improve on previous models with better sound, clearer voice calls, and an even more comfortable design. For $50 extra, you can purchase a model with active noise cancellation and wireless charging.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 $99 at Amazon\n $129 $99 at Walmart\n $129 $99.99 at Best Buy\n\n\nAirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation\nThe fancier version of the new AirPods 4 offer support for active noise cancellation, a wireless charging case that can use either Qi or Apple Watch pads, and a speaker in the case that chirps to help you find it.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179 $148.99 at Amazon\n $179 $148.99 at Walmart\n $179 $149.99 at Best Buy\n\nAt its September 2024 event, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments.\nThe $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app.\nGiven they’ve been out for nearly a year, we consistently see discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, the standard AirPods 4 are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for around $99 ($30 off), which is just $10 shy of their all-time low. The AirPods 4 with ANC, meanwhile, are matching their second-best price to date at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, where you can currently pick them up starting at $148.99 (also $30 off).\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best AirPods Pro (second-gen) deals\nApple AirPods Pro (second-gen) with USB-C charging case\nThe second-gen AirPods Pro improve upon Apple’s original pair with much better noise cancellation, sound quality, and onboard volume controls. The latest refresh also ships with a USB-C charging case, as opposed to Lightning.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $169 at Amazon\n $249 $169 at Walmart\n $249.99 $169.99 at Best Buy\n\nIn 2022, Apple released the second-gen AirPods Pro, which feature a similar build to the first-gen model but offer better noise cancellation, swipe-based controls, and an extra-small pair of swappable silicone ear tips for smaller ears. Apple followed up a year later with a minor refresh, one that features a USB-C charging case and an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. The newest model also supports lossless audio when used with Apple’s new Vision Pro headset and doubles as a pair of FDA-approved hearing aids.\nAs far as deals go, Apple’s updated AirPods Pro with USB-C are currently available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for around $169 ($80 off), which remains the best price we’ve seen this year outside of Prime Day.\nRead our AirPods Pro with USB-C impressions.\nThe best AirPods Max deals\nApple AirPods Max\nApple’s AirPods Max feature exemplary build quality, sound phenomenal, and keep up with the best at noise cancellation.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $549 $479.99 at Amazon (USB-C)\n $549 $479.99 at Walmart (USB-C)\n $549 $479.99 at Best Buy (USB-C)\n\nThe AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the best noise-canceling headphones for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user.\nToward the end of last year, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a new model that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. As of writing, they’re on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy in all six colors for $479.99 ($70 off) — not quite the $399 low we saw during Prime Day.\nRead our original AirPods Max review.\nUpdate, August 15th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and add several related links.",

      "raw": "Now that Congress has passed a bill that will defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, PBS is taking drastic measures to stay alive.\nIn an email sent out to PBS station managers on Wednesday, PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger announced that the organization plans to cut its budget by 21 percent in order to offset some of the financial damage being caused by the Trump administration’s campaign to stop public media from receiving federal funding that was originally distributed by the CPB. Because of the recently passed bill, PBS, NPR, and all of both organizations’ affiliates will no longer receive the $1.1 billion that was previously set aside for them to use over the next two years.\nIn addition to the budget cuts, PBS’ board of directors also voted in favor of lowering the overall amount of dues it collects from member stations across the country by $35 million dollars — a reduction of about 15 percent from the $227 million it originally budgeted for back in June. Additionally, PBS is giving its member stations more time to plan out how they will raise the funds necessary to pay their dues, which are determined by a formula that accounts for how much nonfederal funding they receive. \nThe move to lower dues is meant to make it easier for PBS member stations — which air programming like Sesame Street, PBS News Hour, and Finding Your Roots — to deal with some of their own financial burdens. But Kerger was also clear in her memo that PBS as a whole is fighting an uphill battle to stay afloat.\n“We recognize that even with the dues reduction, adjusted payment schedule and efforts to raise funds for initial financial stabilization, we all face hard choices about the future,” Kerger said. “We are stronger together, and together, we will continue to stay focused on our mission.”\nThough the CPB is set to begin winding its operations down at the end of September, PBS and NPR — which have both historically relied on federal funding to help fund programming and pay employees — are not going away, at least, not yet. Earlier this month, NPR said that it is cutting its own budget by $8 million and using that money to set up a “fee relief” fund to help smaller member stations meet their needs. But the CPB’s dismantling is going to put a significant strain on the US’ largest public media broadcasters, particularly for smaller member stations in more rural areas across the country. In PBS’ case, this new budget cut is also likely to lead to layoffs.\n\n\nThe Trump administration has made clear that it sees public media outfits like the CPB, NPR, and PBS as bastions for an liberal bias. In an executive order signed back in May, Trump accused the organizations of failing to provide “fair, accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news coverage.” And now, the Department of Education has begun working more directly with The Prager University Foundation (Prager is not a real school) in a way that seems to indicate that Trump may want it to fill the void left by the CPB with content teaching children that slavery and racism aren’t so bad, actually.",

      "raw": "If you’ve ever juggled a phone, a smartwatch, and a pair of wireless earbuds, you know the struggle of keeping them all charged. Rather than go through the process of charging them one by one, a quality charging station can help you manage the chaos and reduce cable clutter. The Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station is a solid option for keeping your devices charged, and it’s currently matching its all-time low of $62.99 ($27 off) at Amazon and Anker’s online storefront — the same price drop we saw during Amazon Prime Day.\nAnker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (3-in-1, Dock Stand)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $89.99 $62.99 at Amazon\n $89.99 $62.99 at Anker (with code WS7DV2YB43A0)\n\nThe 3-in-1 charger features a relatively compact design that’s about the size of a coffee mug. Front and center is a MagSafe / Qi2 charging pad that can quickly charge a compatible phone with an output of up to 15W. You can adjust the pad’s angle vertically up to 45 degrees, which is handy for viewing notifications or taking video calls. Just behind the main pad is a horizontal charging spot that supports fast-charging on newer Apple Watch models, including the Apple Watch Series 10, which can be charged from 0 to 100 percent in just over an hour. Additionally, the base of the charging station has a third pad for wireless earbuds.\nIf you decide to buy Anker’s 3-in-1 charging station, you won’t need to pick up any additional accessories to get started. That’s because your purchase includes a 40W USB-C adapter and a USB-C to USB-C cable — everything you need to top off your devices.\nMore deals to check out\nIf you’ve been thinking of adding something new to your anime collection, now’s the time to do so. Crunchyroll is taking 35 percent off more than 3,000 products through August 26th as part of its summer sales event, dropping the price of everything from manga and select Blu-ray titles to figures you can display on your shelf. Crunchyroll members can save up to 15 percent more on top of the 35 percent off, making it possible to stack for even bigger savings. Not sure what to get?

They support features like active noise cancellation, hi-res and spatial audio, and are powered by dual 11mm and 6mm drivers in each bud. Additionally, each earbud stem features concave touch controls, making it easier to feel where you’re meant to swipe and tap.

Without AC and temperatures hovering around 100 degrees, they relied on the Koonie Camping Fan to stay cool. If you, too, are looking to beat the heat, this exact model is now 50 percent off at Amazon, dropping the price to an all-time low of $22.49 (about $22 off). The fan features a beefy 16,000mAh battery that doubles as a USB power bank, built-in lights, and a remote control. While the fan works well, it can be a bit noisy at night on its highest setting.",
