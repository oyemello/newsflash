      "raw": "The second day of protests at Microsoft’s headquarters involved red paint.\t\n\nA Microsoft employee has been arrested as part of protests at the company’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington this week. On Tuesday, a group of current and former Microsoft employees, as well as community members, took over a plaza at Microsoft’s headquarters to protest against the company’s contracts with Israel. The No Azure for Apartheid protest group says at least one Microsoft employee has now been arrested as part of 18 arrests in a second day of protests.\nProtestors at Microsoft’s headquarters set up a “Liberated Zone” encampment for a second day on Wednesday, and poured red paint over a Microsoft sign on campus. Komo News reports that Redmond Police allege that some protesters also “blocked a pedestrian bridge, and tried to create a barrier using stolen tables and chairs.” While the group of protesters were moved on peacefully on the first day of protests on Tuesday, Redmond Police arrested 18 people at Wednesday’s protests and claim some protestors “became aggressive.”\nAt least one of the 18 arrested is Anna Hattle, a software engineer in Microsoft’s cloud and AI team. Abdo Mohamed, a No Azure for Apartheid organizer and former tech worker fired by Microsoft, confirmed to The Verge that Hattle and former Microsoft employees Hossam Nasr and Vaniya Agrawal were arrested on Wednesday. “Those arrested include current and former Microsoft workers as well as Seattle community members,” says the No Azure for Apartheid group in a press release.\n\n\n  \n \n  \n \n\n\n \n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nA post shared by Maximillian Alvarez (@maximillian.alvarez)\n\n\n\nThe group has been organizing a series of protests against Microsoft’s cloud contracts with the Israeli government in recent months. A former Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s 50th anniversary event and called Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman a “war profiteer.” Microsoft’s three CEOs were also interrupted by another former Microsoft employee during the same event. The group also disrupted Microsoft’s Build conference earlier this year multiple times, and Microsoft even blocked emails that contain “Palestine” after these employee protests.\nThe latest protests come just days after The Guardian, in partnership with +972 Magazine and Local Call, published an investigation which revealed that the Israeli government is relying on Microsoft’s cloud services to store recordings and data of up to “a million calls an hour” made by Palestinians.\n“The company announced last week that it is pursuing a thorough and independent review of new allegations first reported earlier this month about the purported use of its Azure platform in Israel,” says an unnamed Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to Komo News. “Microsoft will continue to do the hard work needed to uphold its human rights standards in the Middle East, while supporting and taking clear steps to address unlawful actions that damage property, disrupt business or that threaten and harm others.”",

      "raw": "Sony announced a $50 price increase on all PlayStation 5 “slim” models in the US starting tomorrow, August 21st. The upcoming prices for a PS5 Digital Edition, the standard PS5, and the PS5 Pro are $499.99, $549.99, and $749.99, respectively; however, you can avoid paying the higher prices by picking up a PS5 at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart today.\nThe disc-based PS5 is already sold out at Amazon, and your options may get even more limited the longer you wait. As of right now, you can get the PS5 Digital Edition for around $449 at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target, while the standard PS5 can be had for around $499 at Best Buy, Walmart, and Target. You can also pick up the newer PS5 Pro for around $699 at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target.\nAll three PS5 consoles can play the same library of games, but have slight differences. The PS5 Digital Edition features rearranged port selection and lacks a built-in disc drive, which means it can only play digital games downloaded from the PlayStation Store. (Sony sells an optional external drive you can add after the fact for $79.99 if you’d like to play physical games or Blu-rays.) The standard, disc-based PS5 features the same tech specs, but with an internal disc drive. \nPlayStation 5 Digital Edition (slim)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $449 at Amazon \n $449 at Walmart\n $449.99 at Best Buy\n\n\nPlayStation 5 (slim)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 at Walmart\n $499.99 at Best Buy\n $499.99 at Target\n\nThe PS5 Pro, meanwhile, has a better GPU, faster memory, improved ray tracing, support for Wi-Fi 7, and AI-powered upscaling. It lacks an internal disc drive, but it’s compatible with the external disc drive developed for the original PS5. It also comes with 2TB of internal storage instead of the 1TB SSD found in the non-Pro models, so you have additional space for stowing digital games. The beefed-up system doesn’t have exclusive titles, but select PS5 titles have received updates to look better. \nPlayStation 5 Pro\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699 at Amazon\n $699 at Walmart\n $699.99 at Best Buy\n\nSony’s price hike comes less than a month after Nintendo introduced a similar $30 increase on the original Nintendo Switch models. Nintendo also recently raised the prices of certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, but Sony says “the recommended retail prices for PS5 accessories remain unchanged.” The price adjustments from both companies are attributable to tariffs on international goods, which were first announced in April and have continued to change in response to President Donald Trump’s on-again-of-again policy.",

      "raw": "The stealthy and no-frills camera is back.\t\n\nRicoh is launching its GR IV compact camera in mid-September for $1,499.95, accompanied by a tiny new GF-2 add-on flash for $119.95. As initially announced in May, the GR IV will feature a 26-megapixel APS-C sensor, slightly redesigned 28mm-equivalent f/2.8 lens, new autofocus and stabilization systems, and 53GB of built-in storage to supplement its microSD card slot.\nIt’s been over six years since the first incarnation of the GR III launched, back in 2019, with just the GR IIIx and HDF variants following since then. The much anticipated sequel camera follows in the footprints of its predecessor with an ultra-compact body and lens combo that’s ideal for street photography and everyday picture-taking.\nIf you’re more familiar with Fujifilm’s wildly popular X100VI than a Ricoh GR, the Ricoh is an even more compact take on a similar formula — one you can fit into a pocket. The GR IV has the same size sensor but with a more modest resolution, a slightly wider lens than an X100, a slower f/2.8 aperture, and no viewfinder (GR cameras rely on the rear screen for composition, or an old-fashioned optical finder you mount on top).\nThat’s all par for the course with previous GR cameras too. Though, one way the GR III set itself apart from Fujifilm was a sub-$1,000 price when it launched in 2019. The new GR IV will sell for $600 more than that — and $350 more than the most recent GR III variant. \nMany cameras from the likes of Fujifilm, Nikon, Canon, and more have gone up in price this year due to US tariffs. Among the hardcore photo crowd, the Ricoh GR line was known for being the affordable option of fixed focal-length street cameras. They obviously weren’t impulse-buy territory, but they were cheaper than an X100 and much cheaper than any Leica Q. Now, with the GR IV at $1,500 and X100VI running $1,800 (and possibly climbing higher) this style of camera feels like a much pricier affair.",

Next week, Gemini Live will be able to highlight things directly on your screen while sharing your camera, making it easier for the AI assistant to point out a specific item.\nIf you’re trying to find the right tool for a project, for example, you can point your smartphone’s camera at a collection of tools, and Gemini Live will highlight the correct one on your screen. This feature will be available on the newly announced Pixel 10 devices when they launch on August 28th. Google will begin rolling out visual guidance to other Android devices at the same time before expanding to iOS “in the coming weeks.”\nGoogle is also launching new integrations that will soon allow Gemini Live to interact with more apps, including Messages, Phone, and Clock. Say you’re in the middle of a conversation with Gemini about directions to your destination, but you realize you’re running late. Google says you’ll be able to interrupt the chatbot with something like: “This route looks good. Now, send a message to Alex that I’m running about 10 minutes late.” From there, Google can draft a text to your friend for you.\nLastly, Google is launching an updated audio model for Gemini Live that the company says will “dramatically improve” how the chatbot “uses the key elements of human speech, like intonation, rhythm and pitch.” Soon, Gemini will change its tone based on what you’re speaking about, such as using a calmer voice if you’re asking about a stressful topic. \nYou’ll also be able to change how fast — or slow — Gemini talks, which sounds a bit similar to how users can now tweak the style of ChatGPT’s voice mode. And, if you ask Gemini for a dramatic retelling of a story from the perspective of a particular character or historical figure, the chatbot may adopt an accent for a “rich, engaging narrative.”",

But it’s already teasing its next big live announcement on YouTube for August 26th at 8am PT / 11am ET, saying it’ll reveal how “something big just got better.”\n\nWhile that may seem like a vague phrase, it might narrow things down quite a bit! Framework only has one existing “big” product other than the Framework Desktop, the one that mysteriously didn’t get an update at its last event in February. \nI’m talking, of course, about the Framework Laptop 16, the most ambitious and most modular laptop ever made. When I tracked down Framework CEO Nirav Patel in February, he told me that the company was “nowhere near done” with the laptop just yet. \nOr, maybe Framework will help fisherman change how they catch fish in New England? That’s what Google Search tells me, anyhow:\nI think the Framework Laptop 16 is a safer bet, though.\nI’ve been quietly frustrated that I haven’t been able to give the Laptop 16 my full recommendation yet — because I want products like this to exist! — partly because of early cooling and build quality deficiencies, and partly because Framework has never truly promised that you’ll be able to actually upgrade its GPU to a more powerful one down the road. \nBut with Framework’s Laptop 13, the company has proved again and again that truly modular and upgradable laptops can be a reality, and it’s ironed out many issues along the way. Here’s hoping August 26th is the day it fulfills the promise of modular gaming / creator laptops as well.\nBTW, in case you missed it: We had Nirav on The Vergecast in March to chat all things Framework.",

The last game in the series, BioShock Infinite, was released in 2013.\nTo help get this new entry back on track, 2K Games, the division of Take-Two that oversees Cloud Chamber, has hired Rod Fergusson, formerly the head of the Diablo team at Blizzard and helped get BioShock Infinite over the finish line, to lead the Cloud Chamber team. “I’m deeply grateful for the work the studio has done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love,” Fergusson wrote yesterday.\nIn an internal memo announcing the Cloud Chamber layoffs, 2K Games president David Ismailer said that “while we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” per a memo published by Variety.\nTake-Two didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from The Verge.",

The company announced today that the shipping date for its next console, the Analogue 3D, has been delayed until sometime in Q4 of this year. The announcement comes a little over a month after the console’s previous delay, which would’ve seen it ship at the end of August.\nWhile the July announcement cited the ongoing mess around tariffs as the reason for that delay, the cause for the current delay is less clear.\n“Analogue has been moving at maximum pace, processing shipping to everyone who has been patiently waiting,” the company wrote in a statement. “Unexpected, uncommon issues are rare. Especially in a negligible degree under esoteric circumstances. We’re ensuring every detail meets our standard.” The statement added that the launch is “at 99% percent. Hardware, system, packaging — the full kit — been set for months. The last one percent is where we’re focused.”\nThe company also says that the currently vague Q4 timing is “intentionally set conservatively,” presumably to avoid having to announce another delay. Full refunds are available for those who pre-ordered.\nThe Analogue 3D was first announced in 2023 with plans to launch the following year, and was delayed multiple times since then. The 3D — which promises to render N64 games in 4K and boasts 100 percent compatibility with the console’s library — is the latest project from the company, which has previously made high-end versions of the NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy.",

You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on X or Bluesky. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.\n \n\nThe best Kindle (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition deals\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Kids deals\n\nAmazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the Kindle Scribe, Amazon is moving beyond books and into the realm of writing — something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.\nBelow, we’ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes there isn’t a deal for one or even any of the products, but in those cases, we’ve listed the most recent sale price. \nThe best Kindle (2024) deals\nWhat does it mean when a Kindle is “ad-supported”?\nAmazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.\nIn case you missed it, Amazon announced a new entry-level Kindle in October of last year, one that was designed to replace the outgoing 2022 model. The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.\nIn the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, however, you can only buy the base Kindle at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its full retail price of $109.99.\nKindle (2024)\nAmazon’s new entry-level Kindle retains a six-inch, 300ppi display and USB-C. It’s both brighter and faster than its predecessor, however, and features longer battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $109.99 at Amazon\n $109.99 at Best Buy\n $109.99 at Target\n\nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\nAmazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The new Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.\nIn terms of add-ons, the newest Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The last feature is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series — at no additional cost.\nPreviously, we’ve seen the latest Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off). Right now, however, you can only pick it up at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target at its full price of $129.99.\nKindle Kids (2024)\nAmazon’s Kindle Kids is identical to the standard Kindle — meaning it packs a 300ppi display and support for USB-C charging — but comes with a case, an extended two-year warranty, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129.99 at Amazon\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n $129.99 at Target\n\n\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\nThe latest Kindle Paperwhite, which launched last year, is Amazon’s 12th-gen model. Considering it’s one of the company’s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. It’s noticeably faster than Amazon’s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life.\nDuring events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we’ve seen the standard Paperwhite drop to as low as $129.99. Sadly, the standalone model is currently only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $159.99 (its full retail price). If you’re okay with purchasing a bundle, you can grab it at Amazon with a power adapter and either a green, pink, or black fabric cover for $196.97 ($20 off); it’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in green, pink, or black for $202.97 (also $20 off).\nRead our Kindle Paperwhite (2024) review.\nKindle Paperwhite (2024)\nAmazon’s latest Paperwhite features a larger seven-inch display and noticeably faster performance.

Currently, however, it is only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its usual price of $199.99. You can also pick it up at Amazon with a wireless charging dock and a black, green, or pink fabric cover starting at $251.97 ($25 off).

It’s identical to the standard Kindle Paperwhite, with the same waterproof design and sharp, seven-inch display. However, like the Kindle Kids, the e-reader is free of ads and offers optional parental controls. It also comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.\nAlthough the Kindle Paperwhite Kids has been known to occasionally drop to $129.99 ($50 off) during special sales events, it’s currently only available for its usual price of $179.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.\nKindle Paperwhite Kids (2024)\nAmazon’s kid-friendly Paperwhite is the same as the standard Paperwhite, but it’s ad-free and comes with the added benefits of a two-year hardware protection plan, six months of Amazon Kids Plus, and a choice of three kid-friendly covers. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 at Amazon\n $179.99 at Best Buy\n $179.99 at Target\n\n\nThe best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals\nLike its predecessor, the second-gen Kindle Scribe is Amazon’s biggest e-reader. It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300ppi resolution, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles are known. What separates the Scribe from other Kindles, however, is that it comes with a stylus, which can be used to jot down notes or doodle in the ebook reader’s built-in notebook. With the latest Scribe, Amazon also introduced a new Active Canvas feature, so you can scribble notes directly on ebook pages, as well as a suite of AI-powered features that can summarize your notes and refine your handwriting.\nAlthough we recently saw the standard Kindle Scribe go for an impressive $259.99 ($140 off), it’s currently only available for its usual $399.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. You can also pick up the base Scribe at Amazon as a part of a bundle with a 9W power adapter, a Premium Pen, and either a plant-based leather cover starting at $444.97 ($55 off) or a “premium” leather cover starting at $459.97 ($60 off).

Like the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, it boasts a seven-inch display with a crisp 300ppi resolution, IPX8 water resistance, wireless charging, and 32GB of storage. However, unlike the Paperwhite, the e-reader offers a color mode, which cuts the resolution in half. Thankfully, it’s still vibrant for a color E-Ink screen despite the lower resolution, rendering it particularly ideal for reading comic books and manga.\nMore recently, Amazon introduced a cheaper Colorsoft, one that retails for $249.99 and comes with only 16GB of storage. It lacks wireless charging and an auto-adjusting front light, but it’s otherwise identical to the first-gen model. \nThe 16GB model has yet to receive a discount, and while the 32GB Signature Edition has gone on sale for as low as $179.99 (100 off) previously, it can now only be found at its usual $279.99 price at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. However, you can save some money at Amazon if you buy it as a part of a bundle for $327.97 ($53 off), which nets you a wireless charging dock and plant-based leather cover in black, pink, or green. If you want a more premium experience, Amazon even sells it with a leather cover in red or black for $349.97 ($35 off).\nRead our Kindle Colorsoft review.\nKindle Colorsoft Signature Edition\nThe Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is Amazon’s first e-reader with a color display.

Right now, you can pick up the brand’s first pair of over-the-ear headphones for an all-time low price of $269 ($30 off) at Amazon and Nothing’s online storefront.\nWhat makes the Headphone 1 unique is their retro-transparent design that Nothing introduced with the Phone 1. Similar to other high-end headphones, they support features like active noise cancellation, spatial audio with head tracking, and comfortable ear pads. In our review, The Verge’s Andru Marino said they were comfortable during extended use, surpassing even the premium Sony WH-1000XM6. Speaking of extended use, the headphones deliver great battery life, lasting days with continuous listening during our testing.\nNothing Headphone 1\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 $269 at Amazon\n $299 $269 at Nothing\n\nBeyond comfort, one of the standout features of the Headphone 1 is the button design. You can control the volume, play and pause audio, and switch between listening modes (noise canceling, transparency, or off) with a roller located on the right ear cup. A paddle button allows you to skip tracks, fast forward or rewind, or hang up or decline calls when held down. There’s also a customizable button on the outside of the right ear cup that can be set to launch a voice assistant like Google Gemini, mute the microphone, or enable spatial audio.\nThe market of really good noise-canceling headphones is more competitive than ever right now, but the Headphone 1 manage to carve out a niche thanks to its set of high-end features and unique design. If that’s something you’re looking for — and you want to save some money — the Headphone 1 are a solid option.\nMore deals worth checking out\nInsta360’s Link 2 is back down to its all-time low of $149.99 ($50 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Insta360’s online storefront through September 1st. The webcam offers sharp, detailed 4K video at 30fps and a motorized three-axis gimbal, which can automatically keep you centered in the frame during video calls. It supports group tracking, too, making it a great tool for presentations. You can also control the Link 2 from your phone, add filters, blur the background, and change between single tracking and group tracking modes.\nThe Garmin Forerunner 970 is the brand’s latest top-of-the-line smartwatch for avid runners, and it’s currently at an all-time low of $699.99 ($50 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. The watch features a larger 47mm case, offers offline maps, and supports three new metrics, including running tolerance, running economy, and step speed loss. Additionally, Garmin says the Forerunner 970 gets up to 15 days of battery life — more than enough to last an ultramarathon.\nAnker’s 200W 6-Port Prime Charger is currently at an all-time low of $55.99 ($24 off) at Amazon and Anker (with code WS7DV2EUISAO). The desktop charging station helps eliminate clutter by providing an output of up to 200W across six ports, including four USB-C and two USB-A. You can charge a single USB-C device at an output of up to 100W, or you can charge six devices simultaneously, including a laptop, tablet, phone, and more.
