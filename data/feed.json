      "raw": "Noise-canceling earbuds are great productivity tools, blocking out noisy roommates and busy coffee shops so you can focus on studying or work. While there are a number of great options these days, few are as eye-catching like the translucent Beats Studio Buds Plus. And right now, you can buy the stylish wireless earbuds for just $84.99 from Woot — a 50 percent discount and the best price we’ve seen outside of a brief drop to $63 earlier in June.\nThe wireless earbuds are some of our favorites, and not just because they look cool. Despite the fact Apple owns Beats, they play well with both iOS and Android devices. They don’t support every software feature — like Apple’s automatic device switching — but they still offer perks like one-tap pairing and integration with each platform’s respective Find My networks. Their sound quality also comes close to matching the latest AirPods Pro, and their active noise-cancellation does a good job of tuning out distractions — even if it’s not as powerful as Apple’s premium earbuds.\nThe Beats Studio Buds Plus are also comfortable, arriving with four swappable silicone ear tips. You also get IPX4 water resistance, as well as up to six hours of battery life on a single charge with ANC enabled. While we wish they also offered wireless charging and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, all in all they’re a well-rounded option that can help you focus while looking good — especially if you own both iOS and Android devices.\nRead our Beats Studio Buds Plus review.\nBeats Studio Buds Plus\nThe Beats Studio Buds Plus offer better sound and noise cancellation than the original pair, and they now come in a unique translucent color option. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.95 $84.95 at Woot\n $169.95 $99.95 at Amazon\n $169.95 $99.99 at Best Buy\n\n\n\nSome more ways to save\nYou can buy the Hoto Flashlight Lite for $31.99 ($8 off) at Amazon, which matches its best price to date. The portable flashlight offers multiple adjustable brightness settings that reach up to 1,000-lumens. It also supports USB-C recharges and sports a useful zooming feature that lets you switch between a floodlight and a spotlight mode, which reaches up to 200 meters when focused.\nThe latest Blink Video Doorbell is on sale for $39.99 ($30 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which is its second-best price to date and $10 shy of its all-time low. The basic video doorbell is a solid upgrade over the original, adding a wide 150-degree field of view, a better 1440p image resolution, and a 1:1 aspect ratio so you get a head-to-toe view of whoever is on your porch. The doorbell also comes with a Sync Module so you can store clips locally and, if you pay for $3 monthly subscription, adds person detection.\nAs a part of its new Labor Day sale, MasterClass is offering new and returning subscribers up to 50 percent off one year of its annual membership through September 1st. The membership typically starts at $120, so that means you’ll be paying as low as $60 instead. The deal also applies to higher tiers, which grant access to offline mode and streaming on multiple devices. The platform offers over 200 classes taught by world leaders, celebrities, and various experts across tech, sports, business, entertainment, health, games, food, and more.",

      "raw": "Yesterday, Hollow Knight: Silksong developers Team Cherry announced a September 4th release date for the long-awaited game, and indie developers are announcing delays to get out of the way of the launch. Silksong is a full sequel to the excellent Hollow Knight and is currently the most wishlisted game on Steam, so it’s likely going to be very popular when it’s finally available.\nPanik Arcade, which was set to release its “hellish gambling roguelike” CloverPit on September 3rd, has pushed the game’s launch to September 26th. “We poured our hearts into our little game so of course we want to give it the best possible shot,” Panik Arcade says. “We hope you can understand — we’ll use the extra time of course to polish the game even further and we hope for your support at launch either way.”\n\n\n🚨GAME DELAY 🚨\ndue to Silksong (can’t wait to play) launching just a day after CloverPit, we decided to delay our release\nour new release date is 26th Sept\nwe poured our hearts into our little game, so we want to give it the best possible shot. thanks for understanding!! pic.twitter.com/QwKwBrBuFJ\n— Panik Arcade 🕹️ making CloverPit 🍒🎰 (@PanikArcade) August 22, 2025\n\n\nTalegames, which was planning to launch the adventure RPG Faeland out of early access on September 9th, is postponing the release and plans to share a new date soon. “This wasn’t an easy decision,” Talegames says. “We’ve poured years of work and love into Faeland, and we want to make sure it arrives at a time when it can receive the attention and care it deserves.” \n\n\nOur v1.0 launch was set for Sept 9, but with today’s Silksong news we’ve made the tough call to postpone. A new date is coming soon, thank you all for the love and support ❤️ pic.twitter.com/Lh07iGLHHn\n— TALEGAMES (@Talegamesnews) August 21, 2025\n\n\nAeternum Game Studios, which is developing a 2D sidescrolling game focused on combat and exploration called Aeterna Lucis, is postponing a planned September release to sometime in 2026 because the game “wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves.” Aeternum also says that it still doesn’t have the development kits to “ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms,” so the delay means it can “bring you Aeterna Lucis at the right time.”\n\n\npic.twitter.com/CUomiRcsZU\n— Aeternum Game Studios (@aeternathegame) August 22, 2025\n\n\nFrogteam Games, which is working on the 2D exploration game Stomp and the Sword of Miracles, is delaying a planned August 29th demo launch, as spotted by Aftermath. “Trying to market an indie game is already really, really hard,” Frogteam Games says. It’s the task of trying to get attention in a deep sea of other amazing games. In the case of Silksong, however, I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale. Tiny devs like me rely on word of mouth and streamers to bring in visibility, and everyone’s gonna be busy with Silksong for quite a while!\n\n\nHead's up – the Stomp demo has had to be suddenly delayed. I'll keep you all updated when I know what the plan is.\n— Stomp and the Sword of Miracles (@frogteam.games) 2025-08-21T16:29:41.176Z\n\n\nEven with these delays, early September is still packed with notable game releases, including Necrosoft Games’s Demonschool (September 3rd), Rogue Factor’s Hell is Us (September 4th), and Bloober Team’s Cronos: The New Dawn (September 5th). We’ve reached out to the developers of those games to ask if they are changing their release plans because of Silksong.\nUpdate, August 22nd: Added the delay for the demo of Stomp and the Sword of Miracles.",

So we clearly know what it should not be, and we are now working together – Ukraine, the Europeans, the United States – to make sure that the security guarantees are of such a level that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, sitting in Moscow, will never, ever try to attack Ukraine again.”\n Continue reading...",

Wireless charging speeds will drop to 15W for devices that aren’t Qi2.2 compatible. A 45W USB-C power adapter is included so all three wireless charging pads can be used at the same time.\nSlightly cheaper is the $99.99 Belkin UltraCharge 3-in-1 Foldable Magnetic Charger, which offers similar functionality to the Pro but in a design that completely folds flat for travel. Unfolding its magnetic 25W smartphone charger reveals a spot to charge AirPods on its base, while a compact Apple Watch charger folds out from behind its Qi2.2 pad.\nIt also comes with a 45W USB-C power adapter, and will be available in two versions: one with a squared-off design and an alternate with more rounded corners.\nThe $59.99 Belkin UltraCharge 2-in-1 Foldable Magnetic Charger is nearly identical to the 3-in-1 travel model but skips the pop-up Apple Watch charger. In its place is a 5W USB-C port on the base for plugging in the charging cable for other smartwatch models. It will also be available in two different designs and include a 45W power adapter.",

      "raw": "Google’s mystery new speaker appeared briefly in its keynote alongside F1 driver Lando Norris.\t\n\nGoogle announced plenty of new hardware at this week’s Made by Google event, but halfway through we were distracted by the brief appearance of what appeared to be a new, previously unknown Gemini-powered smart speaker. Now Android Headlines claims that this speaker is real, and will launch with new colors and the ability to pair with a Google TV Streamer.\nAndroid Headlines reports that it’s seen additional images of the mystery speaker, which will apparently come in four colors: bright red, light green, black, and white. As seen briefly in the keynote video, it features a light around the base — rather than across the top, as on previous Google speakers — and a fabric finish.\nAs for features, the big new one is that the speaker will apparently be able to pair with a Google TV Streamer to deliver spatial TV audio, a trick borrowed from Apple’s HomePods, which can connect to Apple TV hardware. Hopefully it can also connect to TVs that run the Google TV OS. It will apparently also include new natural voice options, the ability to detect unusual sounds like glass breaking or a smoke alarm, and full support for Matter.\nGemini will deliver the smarts, rather than Google Assistant, which is no surprise. The company announced Gemini for Home this week, which will arrive on existing Nest smart speakers and displays from October this year. It will include a paid tier and support for Gemini Live, though it’s not clear which features will be gated behind the premium subscription.\nAndroid Headlines calls the new hardware the “Home Speaker,” though it’s not clear if that’s its full or final name. We also don’t know when it will be released, though a launch alongside Gemini for Home in the fall seems likely. We’d expect to see an updated smart display before long too, since Google hasn’t updated its Nest Hub line since 2021, and we’ve already found that Amazon’s new Alexa Plus works best on devices with screens.",

Now we can add Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra into the mix.\nThe Trump Mobile team shared an ad to X on Wednesday pushing preorders of the T1, but with an image we’d never seen before. You don’t have to look hard to realize that this is an S25 Ultra that’s been Photoshopped gold with a T1 logo and US flag; looking a little closer confirms that it’s a render of that phone in a Spigen case, right down to the Spigen logo they didn’t bother to remove. \nIt’s a remarkable choice because the S25 Ultra looks even less like the T1 Phone’s official renders than the iPhone the company has previously used in promotions. Even Spigen noticed the dupe, saying what we’re all thinking in its reply on X: “??? bro what”\nThe new X post promises that “The wait is almost over!” for the T1 Phone, which originally advertised launch dates of August and September (one in the press release, the other on the site), but now lists no date at all. The company also no longer claims the phone will be made in the USA, instead saying there are “American hands behind every device.” The phone has shrunk dramatically since launch too, now promising a 6.25-inch screen, way down from the 6.78-inch display described when it was first announced.",

Paterson spoke to RN Breakfast after the conclusion of yesterday’s roundtable, where Chalmers said there was a longer-term process to consider major reform on the matter.\nNo Australian voted for higher taxes at the election, and so it seems that Jim Chalmers isn’t on the same page as the prime minister because he was unwilling to repeat that commitment at his press conference yesterday. And he is leaving open the door to higher taxes, and particularly on people’s retirement savings, on family trusts, on a whole range of other things.\nWhen those questions were raised during the election campaign, Jim Chalmers and the Labor party said that was a Liberal Party scare campaign.
