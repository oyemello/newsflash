      "raw": "If the Miele Dreams grill is sorting dinner for you, that means there’s more time for socializing with friends and family.\t\n\nLuxury appliance manufacturer Miele is entering the outdoor cooking market with its new exterior kitchen range, which provides customizable modules and smart grilling capabilities. The “Dreams” modular outdoor kitchen introduced at IFA today includes “Fire Pro IQ,” which is a smart gas grill feature that automatically regulates temperatures and follows the grilling steps in whatever recipe the user selects.\n“At the touch of a button, it heats up to the desired temperature within a few minutes and regulates the heat in its four grilling zones automatically, just like an oven,” Miele said in its press release. “In windy conditions, to make it clear that one or more burners are lit, a special knob light indicates the status: yellow for on, white for off.”\nUsers can also use the Miele app to control the grill remotely for occasions where they need to stay away from the cooking station, or set it to cook the entire recipe independently without having to hang around it to adjust temperature and cooking times. That could remove some of the stress for folks who love to host meals and entertain friends and family outside, but you’ll still have to physically flip any burgers yourself. Miele says the kitchen can be configured in a range of sizes to suit the available space, and that modules are available for a range of exterior appliances, including several gas grills and the company’s first outdoor refrigerator.\nThese outdoor kitchens are becoming popular luxury purchases in the US, so it’s a shame that it may take some time for it to launch in the states. Miele didn’t provide launch pricing, but said that the Dreams range will be available in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland from spring 2026.",

      "raw": "After years of unofficial copies of Microsoft’s 6502 BASIC floating around on the internet, the software giant has released the code under an open-source license. 6502 BASIC was one of Microsoft’s first pieces of software, adapted in 1976 by Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates and early employee Ric Weiland to run on the 6502 CPU that powered the Apple II, Atari 2600, Nintendo Entertainment System, and Commodore 8-bit series.\nMicrosoft’s open-source release of 6502 BASIC is a throwback to the initial days of coding, as the software helped standardize programming language implementations and allowed some of the first developers to use a Commodore machine and learn programming by typing 10 PRINT “HELLO” and 20 GOTO 10.\n“In 1977, Commodore licensed it for a flat fee of $25,000, a deal that placed Microsoft BASIC at the heart of Commodore’s PET computers and, later, the VIC-20 and Commodore 64,” explains Microsoft in a blog post announcing Microsoft’s 6502 BASIC open source news.\nWhile 6502 BASIC and Microsoft’s other early software projects helped with the development of MS-DOS and established the company’s software licensing business model, interest in this early code and the MOS 6502 CPU is still very much alive nearly 50 years later. Preservationists and hobbyists have been experimenting with FPGA-based re-creations and emulator projects, and the 6502 BASIC code has also appeared in museum archives.\n“Over the years, dedicated preservationists have reconstructed build environments and verified that the historical source can still produce byte-exact ROMs,” says Microsoft. “This open-source release builds on that work, now with a clear, modern license. It follows Microsoft’s earlier release of GW-BASIC, which descended from the same lineage and shipped in the original IBM PC’s ROM.“\nIf you’re interested in experimenting with the assembly language source code of Microsoft’s 6502 BASIC, the complete source code is now available on GitHub.",

It’s only a minor upgrade on the first edition, but comes with new colors, stylus support, and a slightly lower price tag.\nThe biggest addition is the ability to use a stylus on the folding screen, though otherwise the 10.2-inch display — which folds down to 7.9-inch and 6.4-inch options — is much the same as before. Other upgrades include a Kirin 9020 chipset, an improved 40-megapixel ultrawide camera, and new colors: returning red and black models are now accompanied by white and purple versions, all bedecked in imitation leather.\nThe Mate XTs starts at 17,999 Chinese yuan (about $2,520). That probably doesn’t sound like much of a bargain, but it is cheaper than the 19,999 yuan ($2,800) Mate XT, which cost €3,499 (about $4,070) when it eventually launched outside China. When I reviewed the Mate XT I found myself surprisingly sold on it, though the price is still an obvious sticking point. \nHuawei’s second trifold arrives before any other manufacturer has released a first, though Samsung’s is expected to arrive soon. Alongside the XTs, Huawei announced the MatePad Mini tablet, Freebuds 7i earbuds, and a MateTV range.",

      "raw": "Roborock, a company best known for its robovacs, is entering a new product category: robot lawnmowers. During the IFA 2025 tech conference, Roborock took the wraps off a trio of robot mowers, with its premium RockMow Z1 featuring an all-wheel drive system to handle steep slopes of up to 80 percent, or around 38.66 degrees.\nIn addition to sporting independent hub motors on each wheel, the RockMow Z1’s front wheels also have an independent steering motor, which Roborock says enables smoother turns and helps it avoid slipping on slopes. The Z1 also has a suspension system designed to keep it stable while mowing, allowing for more even cuts, as well as a blade that cuts to within 3cm of walls.\nSimilar to Segway’s Navimow X3, the RockMow Z1 combines the satellite-based Real-Time Kinematics (RTK) navigation system with visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) to help it traverse your yard. Roborock says it cuts 5,000 square meters per 24 hours, and notes that you can even have the robot mower create certain patterns or text in your grass using the accompanying app.\nRoborock is also launching the RockMow S1. This mower comes with fewer bells and whistles but offers AI-powered smart mapping and can handle slopes up to 45 percent (24.2 degrees), while slipping between passages as narrow as 0.7m. It’s also slower, covering up to 1000 square meters in 24 hours. \nMeanwhile, the RockNeo Q1 is designed for “everyday lawn maintenance” with AI smart mapping and 3cm edge-cutting capabilities. Roborock also mentions a “wildlife-friendly” feature for the RockNeo Q1 that prevents it from mowing at nighttime to avoid disturbing nocturnal animals, but it’s not clear whether the other mowers come with this as well.\nRoborock hasn’t yet released pricing details or availability for its robot mowers.",

It does share some similarities with its predecessor, as it also features an “AdaptiLift Chassis” that enables the robovac to lift itself up and clean carpets up to 1.18 inches (3cm) thick.\nThe Qrevo Curv 2 Pro pairs an RGB camera with AI-powered obstacle recognition to help it identify and avoid clutter. It also features an anti-tangle brush and an upgraded version of the bubbly dock with 100-degree Celsius (212 Fahrenheit) hot water mop washing.\nThe Qrevo Curv 2 Pro is currently only available in the European Union for €1299 (~$1,514), and there’s no word whether it will come to the US.",

      "raw": "Take your pick from four color options.\t\n\nI’ve never been quite sure what to call the category Samsung’s Galaxy FE belongs to. Upper midrange? Midrange plus? Low flagship? Whatever we’re calling it, Samsung is bringing the concept back again this year in the Galaxy S25 FE, which continues to stand for Fan Edition. It’s still $650 like the S24 FE before it and still comes with a 6.7-inch screen, making it a big phone for the value-conscious buyer. Also new from Samsung today for big-screen fans: the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra with a 14.6-inch screen, alongside the less-big Tab S11 with 11-inch screen. They’ll cost $1,199 and $799, respectively.\nMy colleague Dominic Preston got some hands-on time with all three devices, which are all thinner and lighter than the versions that preceded them. The S25 FE gets a slight battery boost — 4,700mAh to 4,900mAh — and an updated selfie camera, from 10 megapixels to 12 megapixels. The 8-megapixel 3x zoom is still a step behind the telephoto camera on the S25 and S25 Plus, but it’s there, at least. It’ll come with an Exynos 2400 chipset, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB or 256GB of storage.\nIf the S25 FE belongs to the flagship-minus class, then the basic Pixel 10 is a contender for the category this year, too. Like the FE it doesn’t offer quite the same high-end camera specs as the higher-tier flagships, but does include an optical zoom lens. It’s a tad pricier at $799, but the ethos is similar. Still, I think at least part of the reason for the S25 FE’s existence is to sit on a shelf near the other new phones we’re expecting next week and tease iPhone buyers with a lower price and a telephoto lens that their base model can’t touch.\nThe Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra also come with a feature you won’t find included in the box with Apple’s tablets: a stylus. It doesn’t offer Bluetooth LE connectivity, but it’s there. The S11 Ultra comes with an anti-reflective display coating, a feature I appreciate on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. And it makes sense on a tablet this big that you might want to use as a laptop replacement. Both tablets — and the S25 FE too — will ship with One UI 8, which is Samsung’s version of Android 16. They’re available starting today.",

The hub, produced in partnership with Samsung, is the fourth generation to support the SmartThings home automation platform, and the first without a Z-Wave radio.\nThe Smart Home Hub 2 has twice the performance of its predecessor, according to a press release from Aeotec, and features upgraded hardware, USB expandability, and support for Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee, Thread, and Matter Controller capabilities for SmartThings. Aeotec says it’s built for local-first communications, allowing most automations to run on the hub, so they’ll keep working even if the internet is down. It’s slated to launch in Q4 of 2025.\nSmartThings users who want to keep using Z-Wave in their home will have to stick with the SmartThings V3 hub (also known as the Aeotec Smart Home Hub). Aeotec plans to discontinue V3 at the end of 2026, but says it just finished a final production run and has plenty of inventory available.\nSamsung moved away from manufacturing its own dedicated hardware hub a few years ago, outsourcing it to Aeotec. In the meantime, it started to integrate SmartThings Hubs with Matter and Thread support into its TVs, soundbars, and other appliances. However, a dedicated hub like the SmartHome Hub 2 is more powerful, can handle a greater number of devices, offer more local automations, and has a better range, which makes it a better choice for bigger smart home setups. \nAeotec’s hub was also the only choice if you wanted to run Z-Wave devices in your SmartThings home.

The resulting Google TV party projector — announced at IFA 2025 — weighs 72.4 pounds, so Anker also gave it a retractable handle and wheels to keep it mobile.\nThe sub — which produces “chest thumping base,” according to Anker — is configured to float inside the assembly to avoid rattling the 4K image. A pair of 80W soundbar speakers fold out on the left and right sides and can be detached to optimize placement at the front of the room, with a pair of 40W wireless satellites for the rear channels, as well. There is a promise of 7.1.4 surround sound, including support for Dolby Atmos, which would be a first for a portable projector. But good luck on deciphering those upward firing channels when using the X1 Pro outdoors. You can also put the X1 Pro into Bluetooth speaker mode when music is the only entertainment required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, we’re looking at the same all-in-one Nebula X1 projector that I recently reviewed and loved, thanks to its impressive image, great sound, all-glass lens mounted on a motorized swivel, optical zoom, quiet operation, and bright 3,500 ANSI lumen output from its triple laser light source. Only now, everything is rated at IP43 to help protect it from light rain and dust.\nAnker’s Nebula X1 Pro — now under its Soundcore brand — is expected to have a Kickstarter debut on September 23rd, with a price somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000. It’ll hit retail channels around March 2026.",
