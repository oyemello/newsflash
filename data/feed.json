From now on, OnePlus will develop its own imaging engine instead.\nOnePlus first teamed up with Hasselblad for the 9 and 9 Pro flagships, and a Hasselblad logo has featured on the camera of all of its top-tier phones since. That’s now set to change with the upcoming OnePlus 14 (which may actually be the OnePlus 15 to avoid the unlucky number “4” in China).\nHasselblad didn’t just provide its logo though. It worked with OnePlus (and parent company Oppo) for years to develop imaging algorithms to improve its photography, once a weak point for the brand and now considered a bit of a strength. OnePlus is now taking that work in-house, developing the OnePlus DetailMax Engine. It’ll be interesting to see how close that ends up being to the Oppo Lumo engine, launched this April alongside the Find X8 Ultra (which, for what it’s worth, has a truly excellent camera).\nMaking things a little weirder, Oppo just extended its partnership with Hasselblad in July, promising a new mobile imaging system to come later this year.

      "raw": "Windows Mixed Reality headsets in 2018. | Image: Getty Images\t\n\nWindows Mixed Reality headsets were left in a non-functional state last year, after Microsoft suddenly discontinued the platform with its 24H2 update to Windows 11. Now, an Xbox engineer at Microsoft is bringing these headsets back to life, thanks to a new driver that enables SteamVR support.\nMatthieu Bucchianeri, a software engineer that worked on Microsoft’s Windows Mixed Reality headsets, has released a free “Oasis Driver for Windows Mixed Reality” on Steam. It’s named Oasis as that’s the codename Microsoft used for its Windows Mixed Reality efforts. The driver, spotted by UploadVR, requires an Nvidia GPU, simply because it relies on features “missing in the AMD and Intel graphics driver,” according to Bucchianeri.\nThis Oasis driver doesn’t require the Mixed Reality Portal application, and it can run OpenVR and OpenXR applications through SteamVR. “The driver offers full headset and motion controller tracking as well as a native SteamVR rendering pipeline,” says Bucchianeri.\nWhile Microsoft should have delivered this type of driver to ensure Windows Mixed Reality headsets weren’t useless with the latest Windows 11 updates, Bucchianeri — who is now an Xbox engineer at Microsoft — has created this independently by reverse-engineering Nvidia and SteamVR code. He’s not releasing the source code as a result, and the Oasis driver will remain free to use.\nIf you’re interested in trying out the Oasis driver, you can download it from Steam. Make sure you also follow the quick start steps in the documentation for the driver, too.",

      "raw": "Qualcomm is joining forces with BMW on a new driver-assist system that will allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel on approved roads.\nQualcomm, which supplies infotainment, driver-assist, and telematics systems to a variety of automakers, is looking to raise its portfolio in the auto industry, as more car companies turn to advanced processors and chips to power high-tech features. The San Diego-based chipmaker says it currently has $45 billion in future revenue in its automotive pipeline right now.\nNow it’s teaming up with BMW to bring hands-free driving and more advanced autonomous features to more vehicles. The two companies jointly developed the new software system, which signals a growing role for automakers in the development of their autonomous systems. It’s built on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Ride system-on-a-chip using this jointly developed software stack. And Qualcomm says it was built “to meet the highest safety standards,” citing the European Union’s New Car Assessment Programme for Level 2 Plus systems.\n\nThe San Diego-based chipmaker says it currently has $45 billion in future revenue in its automotive pipeline right now\n\n\nThese systems are similar to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving, GM’s Super Cruise, and Ford’s BlueCruise, insofar as they allow drivers to remove their hands from the steering wheel and feet from the pedals on approved roads. (Different auto brands have different rules about when this is allowed, and for how long.)\nThe system, which Qualcomm calls its Snapdragon Ride Pilot, made its debut at the Munich auto show today in the BMW iX3, which is the German automaker’s first “Neue Klasse” next-gen electric vehicle. Qualcomm says the system has been validated for use in more than 60 countries, with plans to expand to over 100 in 2026. Snapdragon Ride Pilot will be made available to all automakers and Tier-1 suppliers. \nWhile most hands-free systems are marketed as convenience features, Qualcomm says its new driver-assist features should also help improve safety. “That’s why we believe at Qualcomm that ADAS [advanced driver-assist systems] and automated driving should be as prevalent as seatbelts,” Qualcomm VP for product marketing Ignacio Contreras said in a recent briefing, “not only for the safety benefits that it brings to the car, but also for the convenience and productivity improvements that technology brings to users worldwide.”\nWith more cars equipped with partial automation hitting the road, safety researchers are growing increasingly worried about driver attention and the potential for these systems to cause crashes. There is compelling evidence that, regardless of the company, most driver-assist systems are less safe than normal human driving. Drivers tend to develop an overreliance on these systems to drive the car for them — even after a short period of use. And when it’s time to take back control of the vehicle, their reaction times are slower than what’s considered safe.\nQualcomm says the new software will ensure that the driver stays engaged with the road using the vehicle’s monitoring system. “The system has the built-in redundancy from that perspective,” said Dheeraj Ahuja, the company’s head of autonomous driving. “It has multiple algorithms trying to make these decisions as safe as possible. However, life on the road is quite chaotic at times, and this is where the driver engagement is very important.”",

      "raw": "For years, BMW has been teasing its forthcoming next-generation “Neue Klasse” electric vehicle platform, complete with better batteries, better range, and an all-new “superbrain” with enhanced computing power. Today, the German automaker finally revealed the first Neue Klasse vehicle: the iX3. And at first glance, it has a lot to take in.\nThe iX3, which made its debut today at the Munich auto show, represents the 109-year-old company’s attempt at reinventing itself as a future-focused automaker that understands the growing importance of software in the automotive world. It’s also the tip of the spear in BMW’s effort to challenge the growing influence of China, which has become the world’s number one exporter of high-tech electric vehicles. And the iX3 will soon be joined by 40 more Neue Klasse models over the next two years as BMW radically changes the way it designs, builds, and sells what it calls “the ultimate driving machine.”\nOf course, all that will be for naught if the iX3 isn’t a compelling EV with killer specs that’s fun to drive. And from the first look, it seems like BMW may have hit it out of the park.\nCharging speed and range\nThe iX3 will be BMW’s first EV built on an 800-volt architecture, which the automaker says will enable lightning-fast charging speeds of up to 400kW, adding as much as 230 miles of range in just 10 minutes. (Most DC fast chargers in the US offer speeds in the range of 150–350kW.) The iX3 is also the first EV to receive BMW’s in-house-developed Gen6 cylindrical battery cells, which offer 30 percent more range, up to 30 percent faster charging speeds, and 20 percent more energy density, and they are 50 percent cheaper to build.\nBMW wasn’t ready to disclose the exact energy content of the iX3’s new battery pack, but did say it will power the sports activity vehicle (SAV) for over 400 miles of EPA-estimated range. That’s less than the 600 miles of range the automaker was predicting in 2022, but still would place the iX3 among the top tier of current EVs in terms of range.\nThe first variant to roll off the assembly line at BMW’s newly constructed factory in Hungary will be the iX3 50 xDrive, with an all-wheel drive motor setup capable of spitting out 463 horsepower and 476lb-ft of torque. That version will hit US dealerships by mid-2026, starting at $60,000, with rear-wheel drive models to follow soon after.\n‘Superbrains’\nThe iX3 will be the first model from BMW to feature the automaker’s oddly named “Heart of Joy” computer, which is one of the Neue Klasse’s touted four “superbrains.” This unassuming black box aggregates all the traction, stability, and electric motor management functions that are typically handled by a dozen different processors sourced from a dozen different suppliers and scattered throughout the car. In unifying those functions, the iX3 is sure to be a blast to drive, as experienced by Verge contributor Tim Stevens earlier this year.\nThe collection of displays — the instrument cluster, heads-up display, and central display — combines to form the Panoramic iDrive, which runs on the automaker’s Android-based Operating System X. BMW says it is elevating the experience with the iX3 to ensure that drivers keep their eyes on the road and avoid distractions. As such, the automaker has included physical knobs and buttons for the most important controls, including HVAC, audio volume, mirror control, and warning lights.\n\nThe ‘Heart of Joy’ computer helps optimize drive quality.\n\n\n(BMW doesn’t mention its suppliers in its press release, but the automaker also announced today a new automated driving pilot for Level 2 Plus driving, which it has developed with Qualcomm.)\nThe iX3 is BMW’s first foray into the buzzy world of software-defined vehicles. So there’s a lot of digital features that the automaker says will improve over time through over-the-air updates. At launch, BMW claims it has achieved “superior intelligence” in the form of interior lights that come on automatically if the vehicle’s sensors detect that the driver is searching for something, or a charging port flap that opens automatically when it detects an approaching plug. Other examples include app notifications if the vehicle detects something moving inside while its locked. \nDigital keys on smartphones or smartwatches will be the “preferred” way to unlock and start the iX3, BMW says, while noting that it supports all the major manufacturers, including Apple, Samsung, and Google. And the vehicle supports wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. \nHow does iX3 stack up?\nThe first thing you notice about the iX3 is the slimmer, more vertically aligned kidney grille, which sets it apart from some of its EV predecessors. Some could argue that BMW’s signature design feature has gotten a little out of control in the EV era, spreading lewdly across the iX’s front end, for example. So it may come as a bit of a shock that the automaker would tone down its aggressiveness for its new flagship battery-powered vehicle. In place of a wider grille, we get a new horizontal lightning design that presents as more sophisticated.\nIn terms of size, the iX3 is about the same length as an i4, while also a little taller (64.4 inches) and a little wider (74.6 inches). And at 188.3 inches, it’s not as long as an iX, but is longer than most versions of the gas-powered X3.\nBMW is racing to keep up with Tesla and a new generation of Chinese manufacturers, like Xiaomi and Xpeng, that intuitively understand software and have for years been building vehicles with delightful digital experiences. And the German automaker has been making a lot of progress, with its EVs and plug-in hybrids seeing double-digit sales growth year over year.\nAs governments around the world phase out their EV incentives, BMW will face a new challenge around affordability. The luxury and premium EV space is packed to the gills, with legacy players like BMW, Mercedes, and Audi competing against newcomers like Tesla, Lucid, and Rivian. The iX3 isn’t going to upset the balance too much, but it is an important piece in BMW’s mission to convince buyers that when it comes to EVs with the perfect balance of range, power, and software, it’s the ultimate choice.",

      "raw": "Oh my! | Image: Honda\t\n\nHonda is bringing back the sporty Prelude as a technology-packed 200-horsepower hybrid to tug at nostalgia strings. It’s the first new Prelude in 25 years and the front-wheel-drive-coup antidote to crossover SUVs. Pricing hasn’t been announced but in Japan it starts at just under 6.18 million yen (around $41,600), according to Nikkei. It will arrive at US dealerships in late autumn\nPitched as “fun-to-drive,” the 2026 Prelude features 232 pound-feet of torque and a direct-drive transmission that pairs two electric motors with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, just like Honda’s Civic Hybrid. It also features paddle shifters and a new S+ Shift drive mode that “simulates a performance transmission experience” of a real sports car. Here’s how Honda describes it:\nWith the innovative new Honda S+ Shift system, Prelude delivers the ultimate electrified Honda driving experience with a responsive and engaging shifting simulation, featuring virtual rev-matched downshifts in S+ mode and enhanced engine sounds to increase driver feel and connection with the vehicle.\nIn other words, S+ Shift lets you aggressively mimic traditional gear changes to make the Prelude go vroom vroom. Fortunately, you don’t have to use it. Honda Japan gives us an idea of what S+ Shift looks and sounds like in the following video — and honestly, I don’t hate it:\n\nInside the 2+2 coupe you’ll find a 10.2-inch instrument cluster and a 9-inch touchscreen with support for wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. You also get a wireless charger for your phone and Google built-in, which includes things like Google Assistant and Google Maps for a personalized and connected driving experience. It all comes standard with three years of unlimited data and a Wi-Fi hotspot. \nFor sound, the 8-speaker Bose Centerpoint premium audio system includes 6.5-inch, wide-range speakers in the doors and a large subwoofer located in the cargo area.\nNikkei says the car is meant to win over a generation of Prelude fans who are now in their 50s and 60s — I’ve never felt so seen:\nBack in the 1980s, the Prelude was available for around 1.5 million yen, making it a popular choice for young men for going on dates. Roughly a quarter century after the previous Prelude was discontinued, many are now empty nesters looking to choose cars for themselves again.\nSee, I drove a Honda Prelude as a young man in the late ‘80s and did, indeed, use it for dates.

      "raw": "It’s like a weird robotic dinosaur that can mow your lawn.\t\n\nPlenty of autonomous lawnmowers have been showcased or introduced at this year’s IFA event in Berlin, but only one of them comes equipped with a robotic arm. NexLawn, a sub-brand of MOVA that sits under its Dreame parent company, has announced the Master X Series Concept, which it describes as “the first robotic mower with a fully functional mechanical arm.”\nThat arm is designed to help reduce the amount of manual maintenance that’s required for people who own and run robot lawnmowers, such as picking up any fallen sticks or debris that could damage the bot or force it to navigate around the obstacle. The arm folds down to 44.5 cm (about 17.5 inches) in length, extends up to 77 cm (a little over 30 inches), and can reach as far as one meter away when performing outdoor tasks. NexLawn says it features multiple interchangeable arm attachments, including a multi-gripper, a trimmer head, and an edging disc head, with more in development.\nThe Master X Series Concept is capable of “trimming, weeding, fruit picking, and even pet interaction,” according to NexLawn’s press release. A 3D animated video demo shows the mower throwing a ball for a dog, for example, though it’s hard to picture a pooch that would engage positively with such a visibly not human-looking device.\nThe inclusion of “Concept” in its name indicates that this isn’t a consumer-ready product you can actually go out and buy, but some concept products do eventually evolve into something tangible. NexLawn hasn’t mentioned a price or release timeline, however, so any potential launch will likely be a ways off.",

      "raw": "The Timekettle W4 AI look like a supersized pair of wireless earbuds. | Image: Timekettle\t\n\nTimekettle has announced a new pair of real-time translation headphones called the W4 AI Interpreter Earbuds. They use bone conduction technology that helps improve accuracy in loud environments.\nAvailable now for $349 in navy blue and sandy gold color options, the earbuds are a more affordable alternative to the company’s $449 over-the-ear W4 Pro released earlier this year that looked like the clunky Bluetooth headsets that were popular a few decades ago. Timekettle says its new W4 AI are instead “optimized for casual use” with a design that looks more like modern wireless earbuds, but with a much larger stem.\nThe reason the W4 AI aren’t as compact as other wireless earbuds like Apple’s AirPods is because they contain additional electronics to run Timekettle’s Babel OS 2.0 real-time translation software that’s powered by AI LLM models. The company says the system “instantly converts speech between 42 languages and 95 accents” with up to 98 percent accuracy thanks to its ability to understand and anticipate the context of what you’re saying so it can differentiate between similar sounding words. As with the W4 Pro, you can also create your own custom lexicon for the new W4 AI so it doesn’t get confused when talking to someone about skibidi toilets.\nTo further improve its translation accuracy the W4 AI includes a new feature not seen on Timekettle’s other products. The earbuds use a combination of a standard microphone and a sensor that detects voice vibrations through the bones in your head to more accurately recognize what you’re saying, even in loud environments. The bone conduction sensor also improves sensitivity so you can talk quieter, potentially allowing for more discreet conversations when talking in public.\nBattery life is rated at up to four hours of continuous translation or up to 10 hours when paired with the W4 AI’s charging case that splits in two with an earbud on either side. They can also be used as standard wireless earbuds when you just want to listen to music which boosts battery life to up to eight hours, or 18 with a top-off in their charging case.",

      "raw": "Lenovo’s Legion Go was a polarizing handheld gaming PC, and that won’t change as the company officially announces its successor today: the new Legion Go 2 is slightly bigger, heavier, and costs at least $400 more than the original.\nBut in many other ways, it looks like Lenovo listened — and so this handheld, with its Switch-like detachable wireless controllers, built-in kickstand, and hidden optical mouse, might just be the ultimate portable PC when it arrives this October.\nWe already knew its newly sculpted controllers made it far more comfortable to hold and mouse around; now, it also has 50 percent more battery and possibly the best handheld screen money can buy.\nNot only did Lenovo find an 8.8-inch OLED panel — with the inky blacks and gorgeous color OLED can afford — it’s a true 30–144Hz variable refresh rate screen with a native landscape orientation, meaning even games that can only maintain 31 or 32fps on its handheld chip should still give you every extra frame of smoothness over 30. The original Legion Go didn’t have VRR at all, and many VRR screens only go down to 48Hz, so 30Hz is a nice improvement.\nAnd because Lenovo picked a lower-resolution panel at 1920 x 1200 instead of the overkill 2560 x 1600 of the original, it should be that much easier for its new Z2 or Z2 Extreme chip to deliver enough frames, too.\n\nSpecLegion Go 2Legion Go\nStarting price$1,099$699 \nScreen8.8-inch 1920 x 1200 OLED with 30–144Hz VRR, 500-nit with 1000-nit peak8.8-inch 2560 x 1600 IPS at 144Hz or 60Hz, 500-nit\nChipAMD Ryzen Z2 or Z2 ExtremeAMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme\nMemory16GB (Z2) or 32GB LPDDR5X-8000 (Z2E)16GB LPDDR5X-7500\nBattery74 watt-hour49.2 watt-hour\nSize w/ pads11.64 x 5.38 x 1.66 inches (295.6 x 136.7 x 42.25mm)11.76 x 5.16 x 1.6 inches (298.8 x 131 x 40.7mm)\nTablet size8.11 x 5.38 x 0.9 inches (206 x 136.7 x 22.95mm)8.27 x 5.16 x 0.79 inches (210 x 131 x 20.1mm)\nWeight2.38 pounds (1079g)1.88 pounds (854g)\nPortsUSB4 x2, MicroSD UHS-II, 3.5mm headsetUSB4 x 2, MicroSD UHS-II, 3.5mm headset\n\n\n\nSpeaking of those chips, the AMD Ryzen Z2 and Z2 Extreme probably aren’t big upgrades over the last wave of handhelds. In fact, AMD admitted to me at CES that the Z2 is a match for the Z1E, but with software enhancements. The Z2E is a modest upgrade over the Z1E, according to ETA Prime’s early tests with an MSI Claw A8. Every frame counts in a handheld where the latest games struggle to play smoothly, but I would hope for more. Perhaps Lenovo got more out of it — I recall the original Legion Go being a tad faster than the original ROG Ally despite using the same Z1E chip.\nYou can also now get 1TB of storage by default in North America, with 2TB in the highest-end config. All but the entry-level SKU have 32GB of RAM. There’s also a fingerprint reader in the power button now, which is quickly becoming a standard feature on Windows handhelds.\nAnd those sculpted controllers, which you’ll also be able to buy and connect to the original Legion Go since they use the same mounting system, now have a proper pivot-point D-pad instead of the flat and shallow cross button of the original. They still feature drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks, too, and at CES I saw that the right pad’s mouse skate accessory now locks into place so you don’t fling it off when using the FPS mouse.\nI’m afraid that handheld gaming PC prices are headed the wrong direction. The Legion Go 2 starts at $1,099.99 with an AMD Z2, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. You’ll spend $1,199.99 for the model with 32GB of RAM, $1,349.99 for a Z2 Extreme with 32GB / 1TB, and $1,479.99 for the same with 2TB. I already thought the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus was pricey after MSI bumped it $999.99, and while this is pricier still, I wouldn’t be surprised if that Claw’s Intel Lunar Lake chip may be competitive with the Z2E in Lenovo’s new handheld.\nBut price and performance aren’t everything, and Lenovo already has the $830 Legion Go S with SteamOS for those who need to spend a little less for good performance. The Legion Go 2 may tempt those who’d pay extra for the best Windows handheld experience — though I suspect we may be redefining the Windows part of “best Windows handheld experience” after the Xbox Ally X arrives on October 16th.\nSpeaking of Windows and SteamOS, Lenovo isn’t announcing a SteamOS version of the Legion Go 2 at this time, spokesperson Jeff Witt tells The Verge. As of embargo time, Lenovo hasn’t confirmed when or if the Legion Go 2 will get the same Xbox full-screen experience as Asus’ Xbox Ally handheld, but Microsoft has said some non-Asus handhelds will get it in 2026.\nPhotography by Antonio G.
