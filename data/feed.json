      "raw": "Amazon has announced its fall Prime Big Deal Days event. It starts at 12:01AM PT / 3:01AM ET on Tuesday, October 7th, and runs through Wednesday, October 8th. Of course, we’ll bring you all the best deals on Verge-approved gadgets once they become available.\nAmazon’s latest Prime Big Deal Days sale is shorter than the extended four-day Prime Day in July. Even so, that should be plenty of time for Prime members to save ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The previous Prime Day delivered some of the lowest prices we’ve seen on popular devices like the iPad Air and AirPods 4, and we’re hoping for a similar caliber of deals this time around. In years past, we’ve seen deep discounts on big-name brands like Samsung, Apple, and Beats, plus all-time low prices on Amazon devices.\nAlthough the next Prime Deal Days doesn’t start for another few weeks, Amazon is offering early deals starting today. You can save up to 50 percent off select Amazon devices, including the Fire HD 8 Kids Pro Tablet, Kindle Kids, and Echo Dot Kids bundle. Other deals include a discount on the Kindle Paperwhite Essentials bundle, Luna Wireless Controller, and the Ring Battery Doorbell with Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Camera bundle. Meanwhile, eligible Prime members can get three months of Kindle Unlimited for free.\nWhile Prime Day deals are exclusive to subscribers, Best Buy, Walmart, and other retailers often offer similar discounts, so you’ll have plenty of ways to shop. If you want to sign up for Prime, a subscription runs $14.99 per month or $139 per year. If you’re between the ages of 18 and 24, you can get a six-month subscription for free, with it renewing after that period for $7.49 per month (half the normal cost of Prime). Prime Big Deal Days will take place in the US, the UK, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Spain, and Sweden, and for the first time, Colombia, Ireland, and Mexico.\nBefore Prime Big Deal Days gets underway, Amazon is holding a fall hardware event on September 30th. Amazon traditionally uses the annual event to reveal a slew of new products, including Echo smart speakers, Fire TV devices, Kindles, and more. Hopefully, we’ll see at least some of the new tech discounted during Amazon’s annual pre-Black Friday sale.",

      "raw": "We live in a golden age of controllers. The gamepads on the market now are of higher quality, more versatile, and more customizable than anything from even one console generation ago. If you play games on an Xbox Series X or Series S (or a Windows PC), you have the unenviable task of choosing between several high-quality controllers from Microsoft as well as a plethora of great options from the likes of 8BitDo, PowerA, Razer, Scuf, GameSir, Nacon, and Turtle Beach. Some of them have drift-resistant Hall effect or TMR-based joysticks for improved longevity, yet all of them are good for one reason or another. The days of the cheap “little sibling” controller that looked cool, but barely worked, are over.\nWe’ve spent a ton of time playing all kinds of games (first-person shooters, fighters, third-person action-adventure, racing, indie roguelikes, etc.) to test a wide swath of Xbox controllers, and it may not be a surprise that the standard, Xbox Wireless Controller is the best option for most folks. It makes for a great PC and Steam Deck controller, too. The default Xbox gamepad strikes the right balance of quality, comfort, versatility, and price, but there are several alternatives worth considering.\nFeatured in this article\nBest overall: Xbox Wireless Controller\nThe official Xbox Wireless Controller has a dedicated share button for saving clips and screenshots and sharing them online, Bluetooth support, and a USB-C port for charging up Microsoft’s play-and-charge rechargeable battery.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $64.99 $49.95 at Amazon\n $64.99 $49.95 at Walmart\n $59.99 at GameStop\n\nBest budget option: 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox\nThe latest 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox includes Hall effect analog sticks and triggers, plus two rear buttons, customizable mapping and sensitivity, and compatibility with PC and mobile devices.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $44.99 $29.99 at 8BitDo\n $44.99 $33.74 at Amazon\n $44.99 $35.99 at Best Buy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Xbox controller for most people\nThe best cheap Xbox controller\nThe best “pro” Xbox controller\nA formidable alternative to the Elite\nAn affordable alternative to the Elite\nOther Xbox controllers we tested\nWhat’s coming next?\n\nThe best Xbox controller for most people\nXbox Wireless Controller\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nIncredible value for Xbox Wireless support\nGreat ergonomic design\nSatisfying buttons and triggers\n\nLacks customization\nRequires AA batteries (or an optional rechargeable cell)\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $64.99 $49.95 at Amazon\n $64.99 $49.95 at Walmart\n $64.99 $59.99 at GameStop\n\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Power: AA batteries or add-on rechargeable\nOkay, I already know what you’re thinking. “The best controller for Xbox is the one that comes with the Xbox?” That may seem like a no-brainer, but this standard controller truly does earn this title as the best. It lacks some extras found on pricier options, but this controller is the distillation of all that has made the last 20 years of Xbox gamepads great, and it shows.\nThanks to Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol, this is the only affordable wireless Xbox controller out there. (Third-party wireless options have been trickling out in recent years, but they’re mostly at the high end.) While some hate the standard Xbox wireless controller for its use of AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable cell, that also means it’s flexible, allowing for rechargeable AAs or a battery pack. And user-replaceable batteries mean you’re not stuck with a controller that doesn’t hold its charge after years of use. It also works over a USB-C wired connection.\nBut the standard-issue Xbox pad isn’t just great because of its varied connectivity. The hardware itself is excellent for the controller’s $65 (and often less) asking price. The sticks, buttons, triggers, and the sunken dish-shaped D-pad all feel impeccably tight, with the latter having a satisfying clickiness to it. If you’re a hardcore fighting game fan, you’ll probably be best served by a dedicated fight stick or a controller geared toward that genre — one with a superb D-pad like Hori’s Horipad Pro — but the Xbox Wireless Controller is otherwise an extraordinary jack-of-all-trades.\nThe only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity (button remapping is available), though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its Xbox Design Lab, which bumps the price from $79.99 to $124.93 depending on the configuration. There’s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick one from the many colors that Microsoft offers.\nThe best cheap Xbox controller\n8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nInexpensive\nLightweight and comfortable\nSatisfying buttons and Hall effect components\nProgrammable back buttons are easy to press\n\nLacks trigger stops\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $44.99 $29.99 at 8BitDo\n $44.99 $33.74 at Amazon\n $44.99 $35.99 at Best Buy\n\nConnectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: Yes / Power: Wired\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox is a fantastic budget model that typically retails for $44.99 but can often be found for as little as $29.99. The shape is reminiscent of Nintendo’s Switch Pro Controller, only a bit smaller, with hints of Xbox influence and a curvaceous design that feels great to hold.\nOn the hardware front, the Ultimate Wired Controller features Hall effect sticks with satisfying tension. It also uses Hall effect triggers with dedicated vibration motors, though it lacks trigger stops, unlike our previous budget pick, the PowerA Advantage Wired. Its D-pad, face buttons, and bumpers are nice and clicky, too, despite being smaller than we’d typically like. It has two rear paddles, remappable buttons, and the ability to save up to three profiles, which you can switch between on the fly using a dedicated button. There’s even a built-in mute switch for audio, which isn’t common on cheaper controllers. You can download the 8BitDo Ultimate Software X app on PC or Xbox to fully customize this controller.\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Wired works as a wired controller with your PC, but if you prefer wireless connectivity, the company also makes a three-mode wireless version for $69.99 with support for both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (via a dongle). The wireless version is a bit more expensive, however, and it’s still limited to wired connectivity on Xbox consoles. \nThe best “pro” Xbox controller\nXbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2\n\n\nScore: 8.5\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExtensive modular customization\nPremium look and feel\nRechargeable battery lasts an incredible 40 hours\n\nPricey\nQuestionable quality control\nNo Hall effect components\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 $153 at Walmart\n $199.99 $157.95 at Microsoft\n\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Up to four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nThe Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 is Microsoft’s fanciest controller, and it’s got a lot of nice extras, like better build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, a built-in rechargeable battery, and loads of software customization. Where the standard Xbox controller is constructed entirely of unassuming plastic, the Elite mixes higher quality soft-touch plastic, rubberized grips, and metallic touches for a superior fit and finish. This makes it heftier than the stock controller, and as a result, it just feels nicer in your hands. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging, completing a really nice package for $199.99 (or sometimes less, if it’s on sale). \nThere’s also the stripped-down Elite Series 2 “Core” version with an MSRP of $149.99, which ditches the add-ons but is equally customizable. You can buy them separately in a $59.99 accessories pack, but you’ll end up paying more that way, barring sales or discounts.\nA pricey controller like an Xbox Elite is a bit of a splurge purchase. Most of us are not competing at e-sports levels that require its high-end features. Nevertheless, it’s fun to use something that feels nicer, offers ways to custom-tailor it to your liking, and maybe gives you a slight competitive edge thanks to features like hair triggers and removable rear paddles. In theory, you may be able to get shots off faster in an online shooter with the hair triggers, and you can map the paddles to functions like jump, crouch, reload, etc., while keeping your thumb on the right stick. You could teach yourself claw grip to accomplish the latter with even a cheap wired controller, sure, but it just won’t feel as cool or easy as when using an Elite.\nWhile the Elite is still a great controller in 2025, you should keep in mind that it’s been around since 2019 and a Series 3 revision is feeling long overdue. The Series 2 also has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control — with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft extended the controller’s warranty from 90 days to a year in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of stick drift after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers). \nEven so, the Elite 2 remains by far the most well-rounded option for a step-up Xbox controller — thanks in large part to its impressive build and expansive software experience. If all these caveats give you pause, though, there is another promising option.\nRead our Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 review.\nA formidable alternative to the Elite\nRazer Wolverine V3 Pro\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSupports Xbox Wireless protocol\nHall effect sticks use replaceable tops\nFour rear buttons smartly positioned for comfort\nTwo extra shoulder buttons add unique versatility\nTrigger stops and back buttons offer a satisfying mouse-like click\n\nExpensive\nRequires a USB dongle\nRazer Synapse software needs work\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $199.99 at Amazon\n $199.99 at Best Buy\n $199.99 at GameStop\n\nConnectivity: Wireless USB dongle (Xbox / PC), wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nAt $199.99, Razer’s Wolverine V3 Pro controller is as expensive (or more, depending on available deals) than the Elite Series 2, but it’s worth the cost if you want a high-end controller with drift-free sticks. Not only is the V3 Pro Razer’s first foray into using Hall effect sticks, it’s the company’s first fully wireless Xbox gamepad. It also sports some of the best hair-trigger lockouts around, yielding a mouse-like click usually found on even pricier Scuf controllers (a previous high-ranking pick of ours). \nOther than that, the V3 Pro is similar to the previous V2 Pro, with six remappable buttons — four rear paddles in new, angled orientations and two extra shoulder buttons — and some RGB lighting. The buttons and D-pad still have that satisfying micro-switch tactility and audible clickiness like the previous-gen V2 Pro, but the RGB lighting is more subtle this time around.\nThe Wolverine V3 Pro’s biggest shortcomings compared to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2 are its more basic software customization, its lack of Bluetooth, and the fact that it needs a USB dongle to work wirelessly. The V3 Pro is otherwise the better pick if you can justify its high price, which, unlike the Series 2, is rarely subjected to discounts. Luckily, if you can’t, there’s also the $99.99 Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition that has a nearly identical set of features in a wired configuration.\nAn affordable alternative to the Elite\nGameSir G7 Pro\nGameSir’s G7 Pro is a wired Xbox controller with remapable rear buttons, adjustable triggers, and TMR joysticks. It can also be connected wirelessly to a PC (via a 2.4Ghz dongle) or Android (via Bluetooth).\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $79.99 at Amazon\n $79.99 at Best Buy\n $79.99 at Walmart\n\nConnectivity: Wired (Xbox), wireless USB dongle (PC), Bluetooth (Android)  / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nIf you don’t mind using a wired controller, GameSir’s G7 Pro offers some features of the splurge-worthy Xbox Elite Controller 2 for under $100. It has remappable buttons, smooth-feeling drift-resistant TMR control sticks, a satisfying weight, and textured grips that made it feel comfortable to hold even with sweaty palms.\nThe G7 Pro is actually a battery-powered wireless controller, but its cable free connectivity is limited to PC (via an included 2.4Ghz dongle) and Android (via Bluetooth). You’ll need to plug the controller into the Xbox with a cable, and GameSir provides a lengthy USB-C to USB-A cord. The cable was long enough that I could play games from my couch (roughly six feet away) without feeling tethered.\nI was impressed with the G7 Pro’s overall build quality, especially the triggers, which could be locked by flipping switches on its back. GameSir includes three swappable direction pads with the G7 Pro, which can be swapped by lifting the front of the controller’s shell and popping them in and out. However, its face buttons felt noticeably cheaper than the ones on the Elite 2, which makes sense given their price difference.  Button feel aside, the controller never dropped an input, even when I mashed buttons to string together elaborate combos in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, or continuously cast spells, dodged, and healed in Diablo IV. If an action was mistimed, it was on me.\nWhat the controller lacks in face button quality is more than made up for in customizability. GameSir Nexus, a free app on the Xbox Store, allowed me to remap any button (including the L4 and R4 buttons on its backside), adjust the vibration intensity of both triggers, enable two flavors of hair trigger mode, and set the deadzone for each control stick. You can save up to four profiles with different settings, and quickly switch between them by pressing the controller’s M button along with one of the face buttons. You never need to touch these options, or even download the GameSir Nexus app for the G7 Pro to work, but doing so will unlock its full potential.\nThe GameSir G7 Pro is an excellent Xbox controller, especially in its price range. I’d have liked the option to use it wirelessly, but that wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. That said, it’s something to consider depending on how far away you are from your Xbox when playing. If you’re a multi-platform gamer and want a controller to use with both an Xbox and PC (or Android device), it’s an even better choice.\nOther Xbox controllers we tested\nThe Scuf Valor Pro is the company’s first Xbox controller with Hall effect sticks, as well as its cheapest at $109.99. Scuf emulates Microsoft’s winning ergonomics while implementing redesigned remappable rear buttons (two are removable) and shoulder bumpers that are more comfortable to reach. It also has trigger stops that produce a satisfying click with next to no travel when pressed. The D-pad produces a similarly satisfying click, one we prefer over the softer tactile feel of the Instinct. The Valor Pro is not the most exciting controller on paper, but it’s a solid option for Scuf faithful or anyone who wants more durable analog sticks. Read our hands-on impressions.\nWe tested PowerA’s latest pro-style Xbox controllers, including the Fusion Pro 4 Wired ($74.99) and PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless ($159.99). They’re standard fare for pro-style controllers these days, with height-adjustable Hall effect sticks, four remappable rear buttons, three-way trigger locks, and onboard volume controls. They’re similar, but the Pro Wireless has four trippy Lumectra lighting zones that respond to your button presses. Both controllers are satisfying to use and a clear step up from PowerA’s older products in terms of overall quality, but they ultimately don’t stand out much at these price points.\nNacon’s Revolution X ($25.90) remains one of the most customizable wired controllers you can get (it even has removable weights in its handles), and its software is nearly as expansive as Microsoft’s first-party app.\nIf you’re the nostalgic type, the Hyperkin Duke ($89.99), DuchesS ($49.99), and Xenon ($49.99) are faithful wired recreations of Xbox gamepads from Microsoft’s first two console generations. They’re kind of dumb but endearing (especially the chunky Duke), but they’re unique collector pieces you can also use on modern games.\nWhat’s coming next?\nHyperkin’s Competitor controller, which it announced in January at CES, will be released in October for $49.99. The wired gamepad looks almost identical to the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller, with a pair of analog sticks next to one another at the bottom of the controller, glassy buttons, and a non-contiguous D-pad. Hyperkin is offering the Competitor in five colors, but only the black and white controllers will be available in the US at launch.  \nUpdate, September 15th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability, additional details about Hyperkin’s Competitor controller and added GameSir’s G7 Pro controller.

      "raw": "The latest AirPods Pro 3 aren’t yet on sale, but their predecessor is. | Photo: Chris Welch / The Verge\t\n\nIf you know where to look, you can often score discounts on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. Both the newer AirPods Max and AirPods 4 (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the latest AirPods Pro with USB-C. Events like Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday often bring the steepest discounts, though you can still find great deals throughout the year.\n \n\nThe best AirPods 4 deals\nThe best AirPods Pro (third-gen) deals\nThe best AirPods Max deals\n\nBelow, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the latest AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max. \nThe best AirPods 4 deals\nApple AirPods 4\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 $116 at Amazon\n $129 $116 at Walmart\n $129.99 $119 at Best Buy\n\n\nAirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179 $168.99 at Amazon\n $179 $168.99 at Walmart\n $179.99 $172 at Best Buy\n\nAt its September 2024 event, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments.\nThe $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app.\nGiven they’ve been out for nearly a year, we consistently see discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, the standard AirPods 4 are on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $116 ($13 off), which is $27 shy of their all-time low. The AirPods 4 with ANC, meanwhile, are available at Amazon and Walmart for their typical sale price of $168.99 (also $10 off), which is a far cry from their Prime Day low of $119.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best AirPods Pro (third-gen) deals\nAirPods Pro 3\nThe third-gen AirPods Pro add a new built-in heart rate sensor and live translation feature. They also improve upon their predecessor with twice the noise cancellation, better sound, and a fifth swappable ear tip option.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Best Buy\n $249 at Walmart\n\nAt its recent “Awe Dropping” event, Apple introduced the new AirPods Pro 3. In addition to improved noise cancellation and sound, the earbuds now include a built-in heart rate sensor that syncs with the iPhone Fitness app to track your pulse and calories burned across more than 50 workout types — essentially doubling as a fitness tracker. They’re also more comfortable and secure than their predecessor, thanks to a redesigned, more angled fit and five ear tip sizes, including a new XXS option. On top of that, they carry a more robust  IP57 rating for dust, water, and sweat resistance and debut a live translation feature that generally conveys the gist well, though with enough errors that it can’t beat a human interpreter.\nBecause the AirPods Pro 3 are brand new and won’t hit shelves until September 19th, there aren’t any deals available yet. For now, you can only pick them up at their full $249 price from Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.\nRead our full AirPods Pro 3 review.\nApple AirPods Pro (second-gen) with USB-C charging case\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $199 at Amazon\n $249 $199 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nHowever, if you’re looking to save, the second-gen AirPods Pro with USB-C remain a solid option and are still widely available despite no longer being part of Apple’s official lineup. They’re currently available at Amazon and Walmart for $199 ($50 off), which is their typical sale price and a relatively minor discount compared to previous sales. While they lack the AirPods Pro 3’s heart rate sensor, live translation feature, and new XXS ear tips, the second-gen AirPods Pro still deliver excellent noise cancellation that outperforms the first-gen model. They also add swipe-based controls and an extra-small fourth ear tip. Apple additionally updated them in 2023 with a USB-C charging case and an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance, while the latest version also supports lossless audio when used with Apple’s Vision Pro headset and doubles as a pair of FDA-approved hearing aids.\n\n\n\nRead our AirPods Pro with USB-C impressions.\nThe best AirPods Max deals\nApple AirPods Max\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $549 $499.99 at Amazon (USB-C)\n $549 $499.99 at Walmart (USB-C)\n $549 $499.99 at Best Buy (USB-C)\n\nThe AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the best noise-canceling headphones for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user.\nToward the end of last year, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a new model that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. As of this writing, they’re on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart in select colors starting at $499.99 ($50 off), which isn’t nearly as low as the $399 asking price we saw during Prime Day.\nRead our original AirPods Max review.\nUpdate, September 15th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and to mention the new AirPods Pro 3.",

      "raw": "The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is done with its role in the Epic Google case, and Google won’t be happy with the result. On Friday, the court completely denied its petition to have its Epic v. Google case re-heard — and pressed play on a permanent injunction that will force Google to begin cracking open its Android app store.\nUnless or until the US Supreme Court decides to hear the case, Google will be forced to let developers bypass its Google Play Billing app store payment system, and let them link to outside app store downloads, within 30 days. And that’s just the start. Google will also be forced to carry rival app stores inside the Google Play Store and share its full catalog of apps with those stores by summer 2026 unless the Supreme Court grants a stay.\nEpic already won its case at the Ninth Circuit on July 31st, when a three-judge panel decided not to overturn the unanimous jury verdict from 2023 that Google’s app store and payment systems had become illegal monopolies. But Google argued that the Supreme Court might see things differently, and asked for what’s called an “en banc” review where the whole Ninth Circuit weighs in. \nBut not a single additional Ninth Circuit judge wanted to re-hear the case, the court wrote on Friday, denying Google’s petition. And with that, the Ninth Circuit also restarted the clock on forcefully cracking open Android, giving the company a new deadline of just 30 days to begin complying, and 10 months until Google must open up its app store to rivals. That’s up from 14 days and 8 months previously.\nSo, what must Google do by October? Here’s the TL;DR:\nStop Google from forcing app developers to use Google Play Billing\nLet Android developers tell users about other ways to pay from within the Play Store\nLet Android developers link to ways to download their apps outside of the Play Store\nLet developers set their own prices\nStop sharing money or perks with phonemakers, carriers, and app developers in exchange for Google Play exclusivity or preinstallation\nWork with Epic to resolve any disputes as Google builds a system to let rival app stores in\nDon’t take my word for it; here’s the full text directly out of Judge Donato’s original permanent injunction for the parts that now have a 30-day deadline:\n4. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not share revenue generated by the Google Play Store with any person or entity that distributes Android apps, or has stated that it will launch or is considering launching an Android app distribution platform or store.\n5. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not condition a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service, on an agreement by an app developer to launch an app first or exclusively in the Google Play Store.\n6. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not condition a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service, on an agreement by an app developer not to launch on a third-party Android app distribution platform or store a version of an app that includes features not available in, or is otherwise different from, the version of the app offered on the Google Play Store.\n7. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not condition a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service, on an agreement with an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or carrier to preinstall the Google Play Store on any specific location on an Android device.\n9. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not require the use of Google Play Billing in apps distributed on the Google Play Store, or prohibit the use of in-app payment methods other than Google Play Billing. Google may not prohibit a developer from communicating with users about the availability of a payment method other than Google Play Billing. Google may not require a developer to set a price based on whether Google Play Billing is used.\n10. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not prohibit a developer from communicating with users about the availability or pricing of an app outside the Google Play Store, and may not prohibit a developer from providing a link to download the app outside the Google Play Store.\n13. Within thirty days of the date of this order, the parties will recommend to the Court a three-person Technical Committee. Epic and Google will each select one member of the Technical Committee, and those two members will select the third member. After appointment by the Court, the Technical Committee will review disputes or issues relating to the technology and processes required by the preceding provisions. If the Technical Committee cannot resolve a dispute or issue, a party may ask the Court for a resolution. The Technical Committee may not extend any deadline set in this order, but may recommend that the Court accept or deny a request to extend. Each party will bear the cost of compensating their respective party-designated committee member for their work on the committee. The third member’s fees will be paid by the parties in equal share.\nGoogle declined to answer whether it will comply with the court’s order by removing the requirement for Google Play Billing, allowing other payment methods, and letting developers link outside the Play Store by October, and working on the joint Technical Committee. Google spokesperson Dan Jackson only had this statement to offer:\nWe are disappointed with the Ninth Circuit’s decision – the injunction will undermine the security and privacy of users, and we are reviewing our appeal options. Protecting users and the Android ecosystem remains our top priority.\nI also asked Epic about the committee, but haven’t heard back yet. \nSo far, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has tweeted: “Now Google Play has 30 days to free ALL DEVELOPERS to offer competing payments in the USA — as Apple is required to do — free of scare screens, junk fees, and restrictions!” and “With super strong precedent in Epic v Apple, there’s no room for malicious compliance this time.” He also suggested that Epic doesn’t oppose Google’s new Android developer verification requirements in principle, but “we do oppose any use of such verification processes to block, stifle, or tax competing stores.”\nGoogle has not yet said whether it will appeal to the Supreme Court, and we’ve asked about that as well. According to the Ninth Circuit, Google said that if it did appeal, it would do so within 45 days. \nHere’s the Ninth Circuit’s latest decision: \n\n\nUpdate, September 15th: Added that Google declined to answer, and its statement.",

The video also features a new pair of wraparound “Sphaera” Oakley smart glasses with a camera on the nose, meaning that Meta itself may have inadvertently leaked two of its biggest announcements from its Connect event this week.\nFor the glasses with a display, the video includes branding that says “Meta | Ray-Ban” and “Display,” so perhaps Meta will call them the Meta Ray-Ban Display. Based on a brief clip included in UploadVR’s article, the actual display is in the right lens of the glasses, and the clip shows how the glasses will let you do things like ask Meta AI a question, look at a map on the glasses to help you navigate, translate a sign, or use your hand with the wristband to “write” a reply to a chat.\nEarlier this year, CNBC reported that the wristband for Meta’s codenamed “Hypernova” glasses with a display would use surface electromyography (sEMG) technology to interpret signals from hand movements to help you control the device, so the clip is presumably showing that tech in action.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be hosting a Connect keynote at 8PM ET on Wednesday, where it seems like these new glasses will make their official debut. The Verge will be covering the keynote live.\nCorrection, September 15th: An earlier version of this article speculated about translucent versions of the HSTN Oakley glasses, but those are already on sale.",

      "raw": "Protesters gathered in South Korea’s Incheon International Airport while hundreds of deported workers arrived. | Image: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty Images\t\n\nPresident Donald Trump is trying to smooth things over with South Korea after his administration arrested hundreds of workers at a Hyundai plant in Georgia earlier this month. Just hours after reports indicated that South Korea would open a human rights investigation into the detention of Korean employees, Trump said he doesn’t “want to frighten off” foreign investment into the US — something he has made a priority during his second administration.\nOn September 4th, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents descended on the electric vehicle battery plant operated by Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions, detaining nearly 500 workers, including around 300 workers from South Korea. ICE officials claimed the workers overstayed their visas or weren’t permitted to work in the US, according to NBC News.\nWorkers interviewed by The Korea Times say they were “shackled and handcuffed” and then brought to the ICE detention center in Folkston, Georgia, while their belongings and phones were confiscated. It’s not clear whether the workers were even eligible for deportation, as The New York Times reported on Friday that “in at least one instance, officials admitted a worker was employed legally and forced him to leave the country anyway.”\nAs noted by the Times, many of the workers entered the US on a B1 visa for business travel, allowing them to stay in the US for less than six months, or on a visa waiver program, permitting them to stay for up to 90 days. Some companies use short-term visas instead of H-1B visas, which allow foreign workers to stay in the US for up to six years, because they’re cheaper, faster to obtain, and less restrictive. “Previous US administrations had largely turned a blind eye to the practice,” according to The Guardian.\nTrump has called on foreign companies to invest more money into the US to avoid paying costly tariffs. Hyundai responded with the announcement in March that it would spend $21 billion in the US from 2025 to 2028, with plans to expand car production in the US to 1.2 million vehicles each year and improve its facilities. The removal of hundreds of workers could delay these plans, as Hyundai has already pushed back the opening of its Georgia factory.\nThe raid sparked outrage from South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, who called the move “extremely bewildering” and said companies in the country will be “very hesitant” about pouring more money into the US. South Korea’s security advisor Wi Sung-Lac added that the government would work with the US to carve out clearer guidelines for visa requirements, as well as potentially develop a new category for Korean workers, according to Reuters.\nThe incident puts the Trump administration on shaky ground with South Korea, which has long remained an ally of the US. In a post on Truth Social, President Trump wrote that he would like to bring foreign workers to the US to “teach and train” employees based in the US. “We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometime into the not too distant future!”",

      "raw": "One of Google’s top executives defended its use of AI summaries in search results during an AI summit in New York on Monday. \nWhen asked about a new lawsuit by Rolling Stone’s parent company, Penske Media Corporation, over Google’s AI Overviews, the company’s vice president of government affairs and public policy Markham Erickson said user preferences are shifting away from “factual answers” provided by original websites to the contextual summaries provided by AI Overviews, which appear at the top of the main page of search results. The company’s goal, Erickson said, is to maintain a “healthy ecosystem” with both AI summaries and regular search results, sometimes referred to as 10 blue links.\nEvidence has emerged recently that suggests that search traffic plummets with AI summaries. In its lawsuit, Penske alleged that this drop in search traffic leads to a decline in revenue for online publishers. \nHere is what Erickson said when asked about the lawsuit: \nSo, I don’t want to speak about the specifics of the lawsuit, but I can speak to our philosophy here, which is, look, we want a healthy ecosystem. The 10 blue links serve the ecosystem very well, and it was a simple value proposition. We provided links that directed users free of charge to billions of publications around the world. We’re not going to abandon that model. We think that there’s use for that model. It’s still an important part of the ecosystem. \nBut user preferences, and what users want, is also changing. So, instead of factual answers and 10 blue links, they’re increasingly wanting contextual answers and summaries. We want to be able to provide that, too, while at the same time, driving people back to content, valuable content, on the Internet. Where that valuable content is for users, is shifting. And so it’s a dynamic space. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure that we have an overall healthy ecosystem.",

And it’s included at no additional cost for Microsoft 365 users.”\nWhile this free version of Copilot will rewrite documents, provide summaries, and help create slides in PowerPoint, the $30 per month, per user Microsoft 365 Copilot license will still have the best integration in Office apps. The Microsoft 365 Copilot license is also not limited to a single document, and can reason over entire work data.\n“Users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license get priority access to features like file upload and image generation, along with the latest technology like GPT-5, including faster response times and more consistent availability—even during peak usage periods,“ explains Patton.\nMicrosoft previously bundled its AI-powered Copilot features into Office apps for consumer Microsoft 365 plans earlier this year, but it raised the prices of subscriptions at the same time. Microsoft isn’t doing any price adjustments for businesses with Copilot Chat being added to Office apps. Microsoft is also getting ready to bundle its sales, service, and finance Copilots into the Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription in October, reducing the price for some businesses that rely on Microsoft’s latest AI tools.",

      "raw": "The best screens for screen time. | Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge\t\n\nHaven’t you heard? Phones are boring now. And that’s just fine! Most people buying a new phone just want something familiar that works better than the device they’re replacing. If that’s your MO, then you’re sure to find something reliable in my recommendations below.\nBut even if you’re looking for something a little more extra, you’ve got some great options. They’re going to be pretty iterative compared to whatever you’re using now — we’re in more of a software era than a hardware innovation cycle these days — but you can find a delightful new device. We finally have a folding phone that feels like the right size and shape, flip phones offer a lot more than just nostalgia, and you can still buy a phone with no fewer than four cameras on the back. Not bad for a boring season of phone hardware.\nA lot of people in the US get their phones through carrier deals, and no judgment here if that’s the route you take — it’s how I bought mine. Just be sure you know what you’re getting into and how many years you’ll need to stay on that Super 5G Everything Unlimited Plus plan to keep the monthly device reimbursements coming.\nIf you’re looking to spend a little less and still get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $600. For those recommendations, check out our guide to budget smartphones.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best iPhone for most people\nThe best Android phone for most people\nThe best high-end Android phone\nThe best phone for around $500\nThe best high-end iPhone\nThe best flip phone\nThe best folding phone\nOther phones we tested\nWhat’s coming next\n\nThe best iPhone for most people\nApple iPhone 16\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nReliable camera with versatile photographic styles\nHandy new Action Button\nMore RAM and a current-gen chipset\n\nStandard refresh rate screen\nCamera Control is a mixed bag\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699 at Apple\n $729.99 at Best Buy\n\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 2556 x 1179 OLED, 60Hz refresh rate / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 27W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nFrom a hardware perspective, the iPhone 16 (or the 16 Plus) is an easy upgrade choice. If you’re switching from an iPhone 13, 12, or even older, those four or five years of incremental performance improvements add up. But there’s something entirely new this time around — well, two things: the Action Button and the Camera Control button.\nThe customizable Action Button, which replaces the mute switch on the left edge of the phone, is a hand-me-down from the 15 Pro series. You can set it to open a particular app, turn on the flashlight, or almost anything else you might want at the press of a button. On the other side of the phone is the Camera Control, which you can use to launch the camera app. With the camera open, it acts as a shutter button with a full press, and a light press brings up other exposure options you can adjust. Even if you only ever use it to launch the camera, it’s pretty handy, and it frees up the Action Button.\nThe iPhone 16 and its larger 16 Plus sibling use Apple’s A18 chipset, which is in the same family as the 16 Pro’s processor. That bodes well for the phones staying on the same software upgrade cycle. They both received Apple Intelligence last fall, which included AI-powered writing tools and notification summaries in its earliest iteration, and eventually grew to support ChatGPT and a new Visual Intelligence feature. But despite the similarities, the regular 16 models lag behind the Pros in two important departments: the screen and the camera.\nThe Pros come with dedicated 5x lenses and updated main cameras that do a little better in low light. And you’ll only get a ProMotion display on the Pro models; the regular 16 features a slower 60Hz screen. Basically every other high-end phone on the market offers a 120Hz display, so that’s a disappointment given the price. If those two drawbacks don’t bother you — and most people probably won’t mind them — then the iPhone 16 makes for a great upgrade.\nRead our full iPhone 16 review.\nThe best Android phone for most people\nGoogle Pixel 10 (128GB)\nGoogle’s Pixel 10 has a 6.3-inch OLED display, Google Tensor G5 processor, 12GB of RAM, support for Pixelsnap wireless charging, and a triple-lens camera system that includes a new 5x telephoto.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nQi2 wireless charging with magnets is great\nAI is actually kind of useful, finally\nTelephoto camera is a nice addition\n\nMain and ultrawide cameras aren’t quite as good as the Pro\nBattery life is just okay\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 at Amazon\n $799 at Best Buy\n $799 at Google\n\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 13-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,970mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless / Weather resistance: IP68\nThe Pixel 10 is an easygoing Android phone that offers some handy upgrades over its predecessor. The addition of Qi2 with built-in magnets is a delight, making it easier than ever to quickly charge up without plugging in. AI features like Magic Cue, which can proactively suggest information based on what you’re doing on your phone, are finally showing promise. And for the first time ever, the base model features a dedicated telephoto lens.\nBut, alas, there’s a catch: The Pixel 10 no longer features the same main and ultrawide camera hardware as the Pro. You’re essentially getting the two rear cameras found in the midrange Pixel 9A, plus a telephoto lens. Still, as a whole, the device’s triple camera system produces images that are totally fine. Beyond the cameras, the Pixel 10 features the same Tensor G5 chipset that’s found in the Pro phones — handy for those aforementioned AI features.\nOverall, the Pixel 10 mostly improves upon what made last year’s Pixel 9 such a solid release. We’re not thrilled with the downgraded camera, but the addition of Qi2 and a telephoto lens helps to soften the blow. If you can live with the camera trade-offs, the Pixel 10 is still a smart pick for anyone who wants a flagship experience at a more approachable price.\nRead our full Pixel 10 review.\nThe best high-end Android phone\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent screen\nImproved ultrawide camera\nRounded corners are comfier\n\nExpensive\nBulky\nAI is (still) hit or miss\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1299.99 $1048 at Amazon (256GB)\n $1299.99 $1049.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $1299.99 at Samsung(256GB)\n\nScreen: 6.9-inch, 1440p, 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel main with OIS; 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS; 50-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless, Qi2 ready / Weather resistance: IP68\nSamsung’s “Ultra” S-series phone is still your best bet for a maximalist Android phone, even if ultra doesn’t quite mean what it once did. You still get four rear cameras — including a 3x and 5x telephoto — a massive screen, and a built-in S Pen stylus. The battery goes all day, the processor is top-notch, and there are AI features aplenty if you’re into that sort of thing. There’s just no other phone quite like it. \nThis year, Samsung removed the Bluetooth features from the stylus. That stings a little, especially considering that the company swapped a 10x zoom for the shorter 5x camera the year before. It still amounts to a great phone, but it’s one of the priciest slab-style phones you can buy, and Samsung seems to be cutting features without adding back any extra value. It’s still “ultra” alright, but it doesn’t feel quite as special as it used to.\nRead my full Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nThe best phone for around $500\nGoogle Pixel 9A\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nRobust IP68 rating\nSeven years of software updates\nBrighter, bigger screen\n\nMissing a couple of AI features\nAI is occasionally handy, usually weird\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 at Amazon\n $499 at Best Buy\n $499.99 at Google\n\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nEvery year, we’re pleasantly surprised by how much Google packs into its midrange Pixel A-series devices. Last year, it was the Pixel 8A, and this year, it’s the even better Pixel 9A. For $500, the 9A offers Google’s fourth-gen custom Tensor G4 chipset (the very same chip that’s in the pricier Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro), a brighter and larger 6.3-inch OLED display, and an IP68 rating for improved durability. Plus, you get the benefit of seven years of software updates and security support. What you end up with is a device that delivers fantastic value, especially compared to other inexpensive devices.\nThe Pixel 9A offers a handful of other features that put it above the pack, like a 120Hz refresh rate, wireless charging, and the largest battery across the Pixel line. It does fall short in a few areas, though — the camera’s low light performance and Portrait mode could be better. That said, the 9A’s camera is still great for everyday snaps, and for the price, the device is an easy recommendation as the best in this category.\nRead my full Pixel 9A review.\nThe best high-end iPhone\nApple iPhone 16 Pro\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nNew tone control in camera lets you dial back HDR processing\nWho doesn’t love a physical shutter button?\nYour video director friends will spend hours gleefully taking 4K120 video portraits of people at street festivals\n\nCamera Control button is a little fiddly\nDefault photo processing is more aggressive than ever\nThe most incremental of incremental upgrades over the iPhone 15 Pro\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 $745.06 at Amazon (Renewed)\n $999.99 $899.99 at Best Buy\n\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A18 Pro Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.8 with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 27W wired, 25W MagSafe wireless, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nLike all mainline iPhone 16 models, the 16 Pro gained the new Camera Control button, but it got another important update, too: a 5x telephoto lens. In the 15 series, that longer telephoto lens was reserved for the bigger Pro Max model. This time around, it’s on the smaller Pro, too, making it a great option for someone who wants to upgrade without upsizing their phone.\nLike the Pro Max, the iPhone 16 Pro uses an A18 Pro chipset designed to support Apple Intelligence, which started rolling out in the fall of 2024. The first update included things like notification summaries and the new glowing-border Siri UI, which Apple centered its launch event on. Subsequent updates brought ChatGPT integration and Visual Intelligence. But don’t expect anything radical — at least at first.\nOutside of AI, the 16 Pro is a fairly iterative update. The new Camera Control makes it easier to launch the camera and get right to taking photos, and it also frees up the Action Button if you were using it as a camera shortcut. The screen is a little bigger at 6.3 inches compared to 6.1 inches, even though the phone is basically the same size. You can record 4K video at 120fps now. And the new Photographic Styles, which are available on all iPhone 16 models, let you take more control over your photos than ever.\nThere’s nothing here that someone with an iPhone 15 Pro should upgrade for, but it’s an all-around solid device that will please Apple devotees, especially those who prefer a phone that isn’t too big.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro review.\nThe best flip phone\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSamsung finally adopted the big cover screen\nAll-day battery\nReliable camera\n\nMore susceptible to dust than your average phone\nStill too hard to run full apps on the cover screen\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1099.99 $949.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $1099.99 $949.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $1099 at Samsung (256GB)\n\nScreen: 6.9-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 4.1-inch, 948p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Samsung Exynos 2500 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,300mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather resistance: IP48\nSamsung finally got the memo with the Galaxy Z Flip 7’s cover screen. The company’s latest flip phone ditches the file folder-shaped look of its predecessor for a 4.1-inch, edge-to-edge display that wraps around the cameras. With more outer screen real estate, it’s easier to respond to texts and punch in a coffee order without flipping open the phone and getting sucked into a digital rabbit hole.\nThe Flip 7 still makes you jump through a few hoops if you want to run full apps on the cover screen, but once you’ve wrangled the settings, it unlocks a lot of convenience for everyday tasks. That said, the cover screen isn’t perfect for every app. Sometimes a button hides behind the camera cutout, forcing you to change the app’s window size. But most tasks are a breeze, and opening the phone is always an option.\nUnder the hood, Samsung swapped out Qualcomm’s processor for an in-house Exynos chip, though we didn’t notice any hits to performance. The new 4,300mAh battery will last you all day with moderate use, but heavy gaming and hotspot use will significantly impact battery life. The camera system, meanwhile, remains unchanged from the Z Flip 6, which isn’t a bad thing. You still get a 50-megapixel main shooter and all the fun flex mode tricks, which are great for capturing candids.\nUnfortunately, the Flip 7 still offers no protection against fine particles like dust or sand, which might work their way into the hinge and cause damage. This raises concerns about how the device hold up over time. But Samsung’s beefed-up warranty and repair program can provide extra peace of mind. Plus, with seven years of OS and security updates, the Flip 7 should prove reliable until you decide to upgrade.\nRead our full Galaxy Z Flip 7 review.\nThe best folding phone\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nRidiculously slim and light for a foldable\nAll-day battery with moderate use\nOuter screen finally feels normal\n\nIt’s $2,000\nDurability still a concern\nCamera bump makes it wobble on a table\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1999.99 at Amazon(256GB)\n $1999.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $2119.99 at Samsung (512GB)\n\nScreen: 8-inch, 1968p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.5-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 4,400mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather resistance: IP48\nOne of our biggest criticisms of the Z Fold series has been that it feels too narrow and cramped when closed. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 fixes that. With a more familiar 21:9 aspect ratio, it no longer feels like you’re holding a TV remote control. The result is a book-style foldable that mostly feels like a regular slab-style phone. It’s nearly as slim, too, so it doesn’t feel as bulky in your pocket.\nThe Z Fold 7’s reworked proportions make it easier to wield when replying to texts and Slack messages. When you start craving more screen real estate, the device opens to reveal a spacious 8-inch inner display, giving you an entirely different experience that’s perfect for managing multiple tabs in Chrome and playing games like Diablo Immortal. It’s great for multitasking — being able to track your Uber driver’s arrival time on one half of the screen while replying to emails on the other half is incredibly useful.\nThe bad news? The Z Fold 7 costs $1,999, making the barrier of entry very high. It also has one of the largest camera bumps we’ve encountered in a phone and doesn’t carry a formal dust resistance rating, meaning even a small amount of dust has the potential to cause significant damage to the hinge. Despite these shortcomings, however, Samsung has created a luxurious foldable that’s thinner, lighter, and incredibly nice to use.\nRead our full Galaxy Z Fold 7 review.\nOther phones we tested\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 is a very good device, and it’s basically the last small-ish Android phone you can buy in the US. I find the software to be fussier and more cluttered than the Pixel 9’s, so it’s not my overall pick, but it’s a reliable device — and your best bet for a phone that isn’t gigantic. Read our review.\nThe iPhone 16E is a great phone that makes a lot of interesting trade-offs. Apple’s latest entry-level phone starts at $599 and comes with the company’s latest A18 processor, USB-C and wireless charging, a 60Hz OLED display, and the customizable Action Button found on Apple’s more premium handsets. The 6.1-inch phone doesn’t have MagSafe support or a Camera Control button, though, and it’s limited to a single 48-megapixel Fusion camera (sorry, ultrawide stans). That makes it hard for us to recommend over the standard iPhone 16, even if it does start at $200 less. Read our review.\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is an excellent foldable that exemplifies what makes the brand’s phones so unique. It’s one of the best-looking phones you can buy, thanks to its gold-bronze chassis and wooden back. Plus, it features a spacious cover screen that’s handy for quickly performing tasks without opening the device. However, as much as we enjoy the Razr Ultra, Motorola’s promise of three OS upgrades and four years of security updates is on the shorter side. Read our review.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is an ultra-thin alternative to the big, chunky flagships we’ve seen over the past year. At just 5.8mm thick, it packs a 6.7-inch 1440p OLED display with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, a 3,900mAh battery, and a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. Despite its thinner frame, battery life is surprisingly acceptable, though it won’t last as long as other flagship devices. The S25 Edge also lacks a telephoto camera, so it’s not the best phone for portrait photos. Read our review.\nThe OnePlus 13R stands out in two key ways: battery life and screen. The 6.78-inch OLED display has a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz and a resolution of 1264 x 2780, both of which are great specs for a midrange phone. Meanwhile, its 6,000mAh battery can last for a long time — most people are likely to squeeze out two days before the device needs to be recharged. That said, the 13R lacks features like wireless charging and more robust water resistance, and OnePlus is only promising four major OS upgrades and six years of security updates, which is fewer than the seven years of OS upgrades on the Google Pixel 9A. Read our review.\nThe Nothing Phone 3 is the brand’s “first true flagship phone,” with a 6.67-inch OLED screen, a Snapdragon 8S Gen 4 chip, and a 5,150mAh battery. It also features four cameras — three on the back and one on the front — all of which are 50 megapixels. Additionally, the Phone 3 ditches Nothing’s signature light strips for a small dot-matrix LED display on the back, which can display images or emoji tied to specific apps and contacts. Read our review.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold is an impressive sophomore effort from Google. Like the Z Fold 7, the outer screen matches the dimensions of a regular slab-style phone, while the inner screen is great for multitasking. The whole package is also light enough that it sometimes doesn’t feel like you’re holding a foldable, though it does suffer from a slightly downgraded camera system compared to other Pixel 9 devices. There’s also no formal dust resistance, so long-term durability remains a concern. Read our review.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro is Google’s most refined flagship yet, blending a premium design with meaningful hardware upgrades like the Tensor G5 chip and Pixelsnap wireless charging. Magic Cue delivers genuinely useful on-device AI that can surface helpful info in real-time, while the camera’s portrait mode is much improved over its predecessor. Battery life is just average, though, and some AI features still feel like they’re being shoved into corners of the device where it doesn’t really need to be. Most readers will be better served by the cheaper Pixel 10. Read our review.\nWhat’s coming next\nGoogle’s Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first foldable to earn an IP68 rating, meaning it offers robust water and dust resistance. The device also features Google’s new Tensor G5 chipset, improved inner and outer displays, and Pixelsnap wireless charging. We got a brief hands on with the 10 Pro Fold following its announcement, though we’re not ready to share a final verdict until we’ve performed more extensive real world testing. For now, you can preorder the base 256GB model at Amazon, Best Buy, or directly from Google starting at $1,799, with a release to come on Thursday, October 9th.\nAt its fall hardware keynote, Apple announced the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and the slimmed down iPhone Air. The Air is Apple’s thinnest device yet at 5.6mm, while the entry-level iPhone 17 got an upgraded 6.3-inch ProMotion display, making it a really great deal. Meanwhile, the Pro models boast a powerful A19 Pro chip and a three-camera system — all of which are 48-megapixels. The 17 Pro Max also features the biggest battery ever in an iPhone, promising up to 39 hours of video playback. The latest iPhones are available to preorder now, with a launch set for Friday, September 19th.\nUpdate, September 15th: Adjusted pricing / availability, added the Google Pixel 10 as the “best Android phone for most people,” and added insights for the Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and the 2025 iPhone lineup.
