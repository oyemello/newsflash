      "raw": "Details leak about the AI gadgets that Jony Ive (left) and Sam Altman (right) may be cooking up.\t\n\nOne of the mysterious AI devices that OpenAI is considering developing with Apple’s former chief design officer, Jony Ive, “resembles a smart speaker without a display,” The Information reports. People “with direct knowledge of the matter” told the publication that OpenAI has already secured a contract with Luxshare, and has also approached Goertek — two of Apple’s product assemblers — to supply components like speaker modules for its future lineup of AI gadgets.\nOpenAI has also considered building glasses, a digital voice recorder, and a wearable pin, according to sources speaking to The Information, with the first products being targeted for release in late 2026 or early 2027.\nIn May, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he envisioned a “family of devices” being born from the partnership with Ive, the first of which was described as being pocket-size, contextually aware, and screen-free. That tracks with these new rumors about OpenAI’s first device, but this is the first time that information has leaked about additional gadgets. \nAltman previously said that OpenAI’s first AI device wouldn’t be a pair of glasses, but these rumors suggest that smart eyewear may follow its initial product launch. An AI pin would be a surprising addition, given Ive wasn’t keen to develop a body-wearable and had slammed the Humane AI Pin. Previous reports also suggest that Altman and Ive have considered developing an in-ear device, which is notably absent in this rumored upcoming product lineup.\nThe Information’s sources say the ChatGPT maker has started tapping into Apple’s supply chain network in China to help produce these devices. Luxshare is a major assembler of iPhones and AirPods, while Goertek assembles AirPods, HomePods, and Apple Watches. Apple reportedly canceled a meeting with manufacturing and supply chain teams in China last month over concerns it would keep executives away from the company’s US headquarters, at a time when they were needed to prevent defections to OpenAI, according to The Information, citing an unnamed person “who was informed of the decision.”\nApple employees who worked on the company’s consumer hardware have also increasingly jumped ship to OpenAI since its partnership with Ive’s IO startup was announced. Tang Tan — OpenAI’s current chief hardware officer, and former Apple product design head — has promised people being poached from Apple that they will “encounter less bureaucracy and more collaboration at OpenAI,” a person familiar with Tang’s outreach told The Information.",

Android Authority dove into code for the upcoming v3.41.50.3 version of the app and found “a significant redesign.” \nWhile the overall UI doesn’t look like it’s changed dramatically, some usability tweaks streamline the app while putting Gemini front and center.\n\nAccording to screenshots published by Android Authority and detailed in a YouTube video, you can now “Ask Home” to control your devices by typing or saying what you want to happen or to search your video and home history to get detailed descriptions of what has already happened. This is all accessible through a new Ask Home search bar at the top of the app, which, according to AA, opens a new “Ask Home” conversation screen.\nGoogle had already announced that Gemini for Home is coming to  Google’s smart speakers and displays, allowing you to use natural language to control smart home devices with your voice, so it’s logical that this function will also be part of the Home app.\nOther updates AA spotted included that the Favorites tab has been renamed to Home, and the Devices and Settings tab has gone from the bottom bar, leaving only three icons . (Devices will now be accessible via a grid icon in the Home tab.)\nIt looks like you will also be able to add outdoor air quality and temperature as a favorite tile, and there are new icons for video and a thermometer on the Home page. The latter may hint at upcoming Nest hardware, which is slated to launch next month.\nI hope this big app refresh will also bring the many features Google has been trialing in its Public Preview program to all users.",

      "raw": "The Apple Watch Series 11 hasn’t received a discount yet, but you can save on the Series 10. | Photo: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\t\n\nApple recently launched its latest fleet of smartwatches, including the Apple Watch Series 11, the the SE 3, and the Ultra 3. Each wearable offers something a little different (their prices indicate their breadth of features). A new generation of watches means we probably won’t see big price drops soon, but we’re officially beginning our watch so we can note any change in price. Additionally, we’re still recommending some recent predecessors in Apple’s portfolio, the Series 10 and Ultra 2, for which discounts are fairly common.\n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 11 and 10 deals\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra deals\nA note on the more premium models\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 26, launched on September 15th on the Series 6 and newer models. That means those still using a Series 5 or older, including the original SE, are getting left behind when it comes to getting new features. \nThe best Apple Watch Series 11 and 10 deals\nThe Apple Watch Series 11 is an iterative update, so those who already own a Series 10 may not feel compelled to upgrade — unless you really want the 5G version. Other improvements are small, including more scratch-resistant glass, up to 24 hours of battery life instead of 18 in the Series 10, and an FDA-cleared hypertension feature, which is also available in the Series 9, as well as Ultra 2.\nYou can buy the 42mm GPS model for $399 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. The 46mm GPS model costs $429, and it’s also available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.\nRead our Apple Watch Series 11 review.\n\nApple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399 $329 at Amazon\n $399 $329 at Walmart\n $399 $339 at Best Buy\n\n\nApple Watch Series 10 (46mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $429 $359 at Amazon\n $429 $359 at Walmart\n $429 $379 at Best Buy\n\nIf you’re looking for a deal, and you’re not tempted by what the Series 11 offers, the Series 10 is on sale at Amazon and Walmart in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which is $50 more than it was during Prime Day in July. The 46mm GPS variant, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Walmart for its typical sale price of $359 (also $70 off), while the LTE models can be found at Amazon and Walmart starting at $429 ($100 off).\nThe Series 10 still holds its own with the same S10 SiP chip that’s in the Series 11, fast charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter and larger than models that came before it. It’s also significantly slimmer and lighter than the original Ultra, with added depth and water temperature sensors as well as an FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature. \nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nApple Watch SE 3 (GPS; 42mm)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Best Buy\n $249 at Walmart\n\nWhile the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 introduce a handful of iterative updates, the Apple Watch SE 3 is a significant upgrade over the 2022 SE 2. Powered by the same speedy S10 chip found in Apple’s flagship models, it lets you take advantage of features like double tap, wrist flick gestures, and on-device Siri. The SE 3 also finally adds an always-on display, 5G connectivity, and support for fast charging.  On the health track side of things, it introduces a wrist-temperature sensor for retrospective ovulation tracking, with features like breathing disturbance alerts, sleep apnea notifications, and a new Sleep Score that breaks down time spent in each stage on their way.\nWhat you won’t find are the Series 11’s EKG functionality, blood oxygen monitoring, or hypertension notifications — those are exclusive to the Series and Ultra models. The SE 3 is available starting at $249 from Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart in 40mm and 44mm configurations.\nRead our Apple Watch SE 3 review.\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $189 at Amazon\n $249 $189 at Walmart\n $249 $229.99 at Best Buy\n\n\n2022 Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $279 $199 at Amazon\n $279 $219 at Walmart\n $279 $269.99 at Best Buy\n\nIf you don’t need the latest upgrades, the last-gen SE is still an solid buy that’s frequently discounted. Released in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which still holds up well, but it has fewer sensors (meaning fewer features), no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to newer watches. Those omissions might take it out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after.\nRight now, the best deal on the last-gen SE can be found at Amazon and Walmart, where you can pick up the 40mm model with GPS starting at $189 ($60 off). The 44mm / GPS configuration, meanwhile, is available at Amazon starting at $199 ($80 off) or Walmart starting at $219 ($60 off), neither of which is a particularly notable discount. If you want the LTE configuration, the 44mm model is on sale at Walmart starting at $269 ($60 off), which is about $20 shy of the best price we’ve seen on the LTE configuration.\nRead our Apple Watch SE (second-gen) review.\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra deals\nThe new Apple Watch Ultra 3 has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, and sports a larger wide-angle OLED always-on display with a 1Hz refresh rate. The 49mm, 5G-enabled smartwatch also packs Apple’s S10 chip, while adding support for satellite texting, the sleep score feature, and up to 42 hours of battery life. It currently costs $799 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Apple.\nApple Watch Ultra 3\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 at Amazon\n $799 at Best Buy\n $799 at Apple\n\n\nApple Watch Ultra 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $699.99 at Amazon (with Trail Loop)\n $799 $699.99 at Amazon (with Alpine Loop)\n $799 $699.99 at Amazon (with Ocean Band)\n\nIf the latest Ultra isn’t what you’re after, you can save a good bit of change opting for the Apple Watch Ultra 2. The wearable runs on the older S9 SiP and has second-gen ultra wideband chip, but that may not matter to you since it still offers precise GPS tracking, a range of diving-friendly sensors, and long-lasting battery life.\nYou can buy the Apple Watch Ultra 2 in its Trail Loop and Alpine Loop variants on sale at Amazon starting at $699.99 ($100 off) respectively, which is $50 shy of its all-time low price. You can also pick it up with an Ocean Band at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for the same discounted price.\nRead our Apple Watch Ultra 2 review.\nA note on the more premium models\nWhile all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.\nUpdate, September 19th: Adjusted pricing and availability information. Also updated copy to include context on the newest Apple watches, even though they aren’t yet discounted. Sheena Vasani also contributed to this post.",
