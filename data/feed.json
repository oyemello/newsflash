      "raw": "Apple Cinemas, a theater chain not affiliated with Apple, has responded to Apple’s recent lawsuit over alleged trademark infringement, as reported by MacRumors. In its lawsuit, Apple alleged that Apple Cinemas and owner Sand Media have tried to “capitalize on the highly-regarded Apple brand” in connection with an “aggressive nationwide expansion.”\n“We are committed to defending our brand, our history, and our continued right to operate as Apple Cinemas—an identity that is and has always been clearly distinct and fully compliant with all applicable trademark laws,” Apple Cinemas says. The company states that the name “reflects our roots, beginning with our first planned location at the Apple Valley Mall in New England” and that it is now a “top 25 movie theater chain” in the US.\n“Apple Cinemas is a long-established independent theater chain with no connection to Apple Inc. Our name reflects our geographic roots and has never been intended to suggest, or used to imply, any affiliation with their brand. Furthermore, claims of consumer confusion are unfounded. Apple Cinema’s branding is clearly differentiated.”\nWhile Apple alleged that Apple Cinemas and Sand Media have “refused to engage with Apple’s repeated efforts to resolve the matter amicably,” Apple Cinemas says that “we have responded reasonably and transparently to all legal communications regarding this matter and remain focused on growing our business and brand in good faith, as we have for over a decade.”\nApple Cinemas, which has most of its locations in the Northeast US, opened its first West Coast location in San Francisco earlier this year.\nApple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Kwon entered his plea in a New York court on Tuesday as part of a deal reached with prosecutors that reduced his charges.\nFederal prosecutors in New York charged Kwon after his firm’s Terra stablecoin and sister token Luna, crashed in 2022, causing some investors to lose all of their savings on a cryptocurrency they thought was supposed to be less volatile than others. Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in 2023 before the country extradited him to the US over a year later.\nInner City Press, which reports on courtroom proceedings, said Kwon admitted to knowingly defrauding cryptocurrency customers and working with another company to artificially inflate Terra’s $1 peg. Kwon’s sentencing is set for December 11th, with the conspiracy charge holding a maximum sentence of five years, and wire fraud at a maximum of 20 years, according to Bloomberg.",

      "raw": "The MacBook Pro 14 (2025, M4) is currently on sale for $1,299.99 ($300 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.\t\n\nThe MacBook Pro 14 with M4 is one of our top laptop recommendations for students, and it’s currently $1,299 ($300 off), an all-time low price at Amazon and Best Buy. In our tests, Apple’s entry-level pro laptop was powerful enough to process high-resolution raw files in Adobe’s Lightroom Classic without slowing down. It also easily clears the system requirements to play last month’s port of Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate to MacOS. \nApple MacBook Pro 14 (2025, M4)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1299 at Amazon\n $1599 $1299 at Best Buy\n\nThe laptop has a 14.2-inch high resolution (3024 x 1964) 120Hz Mini-LED display and runs on Apple’s M4 processor, its latest chip. It has 16GB of RAM, which should be enough memory to keep the laptop running smoothly when you have dozens of tabs open, want to edit 4K video, or play games. Its 512GB of storage is sufficient for keeping some larger files on your computer instead of keeping them in the cloud, or constantly transferring them to and from a portable SSD.\nOne distinct advantage the MacBook Pro has over the thinner and lighter MacBook Air is its port selection. The laptop is equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, and SD Card slot to connect to monitors, memory cards, and other accessories without a dongle. It also has a MagSafe port, so you don’t have to unplug an accessory to charge the laptop. \nSpeaking of charging, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4’s battery lasted a little over 12 hours of moderate to heavy usage when we reviewed it. The apps you use and your preferred screen brightness level will heavily impact the laptops’s battery life, but you should be able to get through the school or work day without having to plug it in.\nA few more great deals \nIf you need a new pair of workout earbuds, Beats’ Powerbeats Pro 2 are currently $199.95 ($50 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. In our tests the earbuds were comfortable to wear (even with glasses), stayed in place during runs, lasted around 10 hours per charge and sounded pretty good. Each bud has an optical heart rate sensor, and both iOS and Android users can log information from their workouts when using a compatible app. \nThe Kindle Paperwhite is one of the best e-readers we’ve tested, and you can get one in Like-New condition for $106.99 ($37 off) at Amazon. The e-reader impressed us with its 7-inch high-resolution screen, faster page turn speed, and adjustable warm white frontlight, which can be tinted to be easier on the eyes at night. It also has IPX8 water resistance, so you can safely read by the water. Amazon certifies it’s put the Kindle through diagnostic tests, cleaning and inspection, software updates, and a full data wipe.  \nSummer is almost over, but if you’re squeezing in a last-minute trip outdoors, the BougeRV Telescopic Camping Light is good to have and is on sale for $45.99 ($44 off) at Amazon or $49.99 ($40 off) from BougeRV. The battery-powered lamp weighs 2.3 pounds, and can last up to 60 hours per charge depending on your brightness settings. It can be extended from a backpack-friendly 10.6 inches to 64.57 inches. The light is mounted on a tripod stand to keep it steady, but has a hook that allows you to hang it on the top of your tent.",

      "raw": "Google is making it easier to see news from your favorite outlets. A new feature, called “preferred sources,” will let you choose the outlets you want to see featured the most in Search’s “top stories” section.\nGoogle’s top stories hub appears when you search for something related to a current event, and displays a bunch of relevant articles from around the web. Along with prominently featuring articles from your preferred outlets in the top stories list, Google may also include them in a new “from your sources” section. Google first started testing the preferred sources feature in June, and now it’s rolling out to users in the US and India.\nTo customize the sources you see, search for a timely topic, and select the icon next to the “top stories” label. After you enter and select your favorite outlets, you can refresh your top stories to see them included. There isn’t a limit on how many sources you can add, and if you’ve already tried out the feature while it was in testing, Google will automatically apply them.\nWith Google positioning AI as the future of Search, it’s a bit refreshing to see the company rolling out a feature that doesn’t have anything to do with the technology. Last week, Google responded to reports that its AI search features are negatively impacting web traffic, saying click volume has remained “relatively stable” when compared to the same time last year. It added that people are “increasingly” navigating to websites with forums, podcasts, videos, and “authentic voices.”",

Rapidly pressing the Clip’s button activates a flashing light and loud 97-decibel siren while also triggering Pebblebee’s mobile app to send a browser link of your current location to a single trusted contact as an SMS message.\nToday, Pebblebee announced more features for Alert as part of an upgraded Alert Live option that’s available through a subscription. Alert Live expands your automatically contacted Safety Circle from just a single person to up to five, and it shares your real-time location with them until you’re safe and turn it off.\nThe basic Alert features are still free, but Alert Live is now available for $2.99 per month or $24.99 per year. Pebblebee is also introducing a Silent Mode upgrade for both Alert and Alert Live today, for free, that sends alerts more discreetly without the siren or flashing light, which the company says is designed for “high-stress or unsafe situations where quiet communication is essential.”\nCorrection, August 12th: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the new subscription service.

      "raw": "Samsung’s first Micro RGB TV is initially only available in a 115-inch model. | Image: Samsung\t\n\nFirst teased at CES 2025, Samsung has finally launched a TV featuring the company’s new Micro RGB backlight technology. The 115-inch TV is first launching in South Korea for over $32,000, according to SamMobile, but Samsung says it’s coming to the US next, followed by a wider global rollout with more size options.\nSamsung’s Micro RGB technology is being positioned as an upgrade to Mini LED backlights that employ an array of tiny white or blue LEDs behind a TV’s LCD panel. Micro RGB backlights instead use an ultra-fine pattern of individually controlled red, green and blue LEDs that are each less than than 100µm in size.\nThe new backlight is powered by Samsung’s Micro RGB AI engine, which the company says “analyzes each frame in real time and automatically optimizes color output for a more lifelike and immersive picture.” The technology allows for improved color accuracy and better contrast by precisely controlling the intensity of the individual LEDs, and Samsung says it can even boost the color in dull scenes, making them appear more vivid and immersive.\nThe other big advantage of Micro RGB is that the technology is cheaper to produce than MicroLED TVs. While Samsung’s first 115-inch model is launching at KRW 44.9 million – or around $32,362 – the company also currently sells a smaller 110-inch MicroLED TV in the US for $150,000.\nOther features of the new 4K TV include a 144Hz variable refresh rate for gaming, AI upscaling, HDR10+ support, a 70-watt 4.2.2 speaker setup that supports Dolby Atmos, four HDMI 2.0 ports, a pair of USB-A ports, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. It can also function as a Matter controller, and if you use Philips Hue lights, the TV can sync their color to what’s on screen.\nSamsung isn’t the only company pursuing this upgraded approach to Mini LED TVs. Earlier this year, The Verge got a demo of Sony’s awkwardly-named General RGB LED Backlight Technology, featuring backlight zones made up of red, green, and blue LEDs. And at CES 2025, Hisense announced its 116-inch TriChroma LED TV, which also features a backlight made up of individual RGB LEDs controlled by a new system the company calls RGB Local Dimming Technology. But while Hisense claims its TV can reproduce 97 percent of the BT.2020 color space, Samsung says its Micro RGB technology is even better, reproducing 100 percent and potentially making it one of the most color accurate TVs available to consumers.",

Live TV streaming services are already pretty pricey, and the ones focused on live sports are no different.
