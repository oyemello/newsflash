      "raw": "One of the most-discussed subjects among many of my friends and colleagues are headphones: specifically, what provides the best sound, the best noise cancellation, and are the most comfortable to wear. If you’re part of the Apple ecosystem, then one of those featured in our roundup of best AirPods to buy are the AirPods Max, which are now on sale for $479.99 at Best Buy, Amazon (where the purple model isn’t discounted), and Walmart, a savings of $70 from their usual $549.99. This isn’t the best deal we’ve seen, but it’s still a bigger discount that you’ll find directly through Apple.\nAirPods Max (USB-C)\nApple’s AirPods Max offer a premium metal design, excellent noise cancellation, a crystal-clear transparency mode, and intuitive controls. They were upgraded with a USB-C port in 2024.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $549 $479.99 at Amazon\n $549.99 $479.99 at Walmart\n $549.99 $479.99 at Best Buy\n\nThe AirPods Max have been lauded for their great sound, effective noise cancellation, and spatial audio, providing an immersive experience for listeners. They also look really good, and fit comfortably. Although, they are a bit weighty, which can be an issue for some, especially if you’re wearing them throughout the day. However, that may not be an issue for you. Or, perhaps you can just overlook it considering their fantastic audio quality. Read our review. \nA few more Verge-approved deals\nRumors and official teases about Google’s upcoming Pixel 10 phones are flowing like Niagara Falls, which to budget-minded folks means now is a good time to save on the soon-to-be-last-gen model. You can get a really good deal on the Pixel 9 Pro (in its Obsidian color) for $599 at Best Buy, which is a savings of $400 over its usual $999 cost. If you prefer the Pixel 9 (or if you’re not in time to get the deal on the Pro), you can find Google’s 2024 flagship smartphone with 128GB for the same $599, which is $200 less than its usual $799 and close to its lowest price ever, at Amazon and Best Buy. Read our review. \nThe Eufy Robot Vacuum Omni C20 is once again available at Amazon for $398.99 ($300 off), matching its all-time low. This handy robovac includes an all-in-one station that empties, washes, dries, and refills the Omni C20 between cleanings. It also offers 7,000Pa of suction, a rolling brush, a side brush, and a detangle comb to handle debris and pet hair. You can also get it at Eufy for that price using the code WSPDV2N0UXGB, but that sale is timed to end August 14th at midnight PT.\nIf you use Apple’s AirTags to track your stuff, or wish you had one, you can find them for $24 ($5 off) each at Amazon and Walmart. This isn’t the lowest price they’ve been, but it’s a decent sale on a device that can save you a lot of headaches when you need to track a lost item. Read our review. \nI’m good at remembering to carry a charger but always forget to bring the cable. That’s why I’m looking at Nomad’s ChargeKey, a small USB-C to USB-C cable that handily clips onto your keyring and lets you charge a device or transfer data anytime you need to. The second-gen version — which fast-charges at up to 240W and supports 10Gbps data transfer speeds — is available for $20 ($5 off) directly from Nomad with the promo code VERGE20.",

      "raw": "It seems like Google is looking for a way to put AI into everything these days, and now its efforts have reached its airfare-booking service, Flights. On Thursday, Google announced that it’s testing a new AI-powered Flight Deals tool, which could come in handy if you’re planning a trip on a budget but aren’t quite sure where you want to go yet.\nInstead of just entering your preferred airport and destination, Flight Deals takes a more open-ended approach. You can describe the kind of place you’d like to visit, and even get specific about how long you want to sit on a plane and what activities you’d like to do once you get there. Google will then use AI to come up with cheap flights that match your preferences. For example, you can search for “a weekend countryside getaway with trail rides and kayaking” or a “trip to Europe with great cheese and wine in May,” and see what pops up. \nWhile using Flight Deals, I found that it surfaced a mix of obvious vacation spots and some lesser-known locations. When looking for “a tropical destination with snorkeling,” it showed me spots like Cozumel, Mexico; Nassau, Bahamas; and San Juan, Puerto Rico, which were predictable but viable suggestions. But a search for a “trip to Europe with hiking” showed suggestions for a couple of cities that I wouldn’t have thought of — Cluj-Napoca, Romania and Ljubljana, Slovenia — which is nice if you’re looking for something off the beaten path.\nStill, some of the results I got weren’t useful at all. When searching for “a tropical weekend trip that’s less than 5 hours away” from the Orlando airport, it yielded results for Miami and Key West, which may not be ideal for someone looking to travel outside the state. I also managed to stump it by searching for “trips to Japan during cherry blossom season” — it said it found “no deals” for this search. \nIf you don’t specify when you’d like to visit, Google will default to showing you flights within the next six months. You can also play around with some of the filters, like how many stops you want, or which airline you’d prefer — but the nice thing about this AI-powered revamp is that you don’t have to.\nDespite some hiccups, I could still see myself trying out Flight Deals if I’m looking for travel ideas that aren’t super out of my budget. I probably wouldn’t entrust AI with planning out my entire trip, but having it generate some destination ideas, which I can then do more research on, doesn’t hurt. Google Flight Deals is rolling out in beta to users in the US and Canada over the next week. You can find it on the standalone Flight Deals page, or in the top-left menu on Google Flights.",

      "raw": "The Boox Palma 2 is currently on sale.\t\n\nIf you want a convenient way to stay well read without amassing a library of physical books, an e-reader may be the right solution. The Boox Palma 2 impressed us with its pocket-friendly size and ability to run Android apps. A bundle including the Boox Palma 2 and a case is $299.99 ($29 off) at Wellbots. From today until August 21st, Verge readers can save an additional $25, and get free shipping, by using the promo code VERGE25 at checkout.\nBoox Palma 2\nThe Boox Palma 2 is a 6.3-inch smartphone-sized e-reader that’s highly portable. It also runs on Android and comes with the Google Play Store built-in, allowing you to download apps for other digital bookstores, newspapers, note-taking apps, and more. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $274.99 at Wellbots (Promo Code VERGE25)\n\nVerge Editor-at-Large David Pierce liked the Palma 2 because it allowed him to read, take notes, and listen to music or podcasts without using his smartphone. The device’s 6.13-inch E Ink touchscreen is roughly the size of the iPhone 16’s display, and it has the same pixel density as the latest Kindle Paperwhite, so text will look sharp. The device’s shape makes it easier to hold one handed or keep in a pocket than a Kindle or Kobo. Despite its size, we found the Palma 2 could last between four or five days per charge.\nThe Palma 2 has 128GB of storage, which is sufficient for holding hundreds of ebooks, but you could eat it up quickly by loading the device with apps from Google’s Play Store. If you run out of space, you can pop in a microSD card to add more. Its USB-C charging port doubles as a headphone jack, so you can download music, podcasts, and audiobooks for offline listening, all of which take up a lot more space than a typical ebook. You can also play audio through the Palma 2’s built-in speaker. The device even has a 16-megapixel camera, though in our tests it was best used for scanning documents and QR codes rather than taking photos.\nIf you want an e-reader that’s convenient to grab before you head out the door each morning, Boox’s Palma 2 is the only one that may reasonably fit in your pocket. Its size and shape can also make reading one-handed in a crowded train or while eating lunch more comfortable than a Kindle. It’s also more capable thanks to its ability to access Google Play Store, though the limits of an E Ink display may curb your desire to download social media apps or other distractions that can keep you from finally finishing War & Peace.",

      "raw": "Hue’s new Bridge Pro could turn your lights into motion sensors — and it’s black!\t\n\nSmart lighting company Philips Hue appears to be launching a new version of its bridge, the first in a decade. According to a product page briefly published on Hue’s website and since removed, the Hue Bridge Pro will be faster, have more capacity, and can “turn your smart lights into motion sensors.” A Hue video doorbell, new outdoor lighting, and a more energy-efficient A19 light bulb are also on the way.\nThe page, which was first spotted by HueBlog, outlined all the new products but revealed no specs or prices. Signify, Hue’s parent company, is hosting a press event in Berlin next month, ahead of the IFA tech trade show, where we expect full details. \nThe standout news is the bridge’s new motion-sensing capability. Details are scarce, but the description mentions “built-in MotionAware technology.” Wi-Fi motion sensing technology has been around for years — Hue’s sister company Wiz uses it in its Wi-Fi bulbs — but Hue lights work over Zigbee, not Wi-Fi. In January, a company called Ivani debuted its Sensify wireless sensing technology, which can turn mains-powered Zigbee devices (like light bulbs) into motion sensors with a firmware update. \nAt the time, Ivani co-founder Justin McKinney told The Verge the company was working with “large household names poised to deploy the technology very soon.” It’s possible one of those companies is Hue, and that Sensify’s tech is powering the upgrade that could let your existing Hue bulbs and accessories act as motion sensors. This would make them capable of automatically adjusting your lights as you move through the house without the need for standalone motion sensors.\nThe bridge will also have “advanced AI features,” likely tied to Hue’s new AI lighting assistant. According to additional reporting by HueBlog, the Bridge Pro will feature a faster processor, more RAM, the addition of Wi-Fi connectivity so you don’t have to plug it into your router, and support for up to 150 bulbs and 50 accessories — more than triple the current bridge’s capability.\nIn addition to the bridge, Hue is preparing a new wired video doorbell, first leaked in March. A new image shows a design reminiscent of the second-gen August doorbell. The Hue website noted it will stream in 2K, an upgrade from the 1080p on Hue’s 2023 security cameras.\nAnother confirmed rumor: Hue lights will soon be controlled by Sonos’ voice assistant. According to the page, you’ll be able to tell Sonos speakers to turn Hue lights on and off, dim or brighten, change their colors, or select a light scene. While Sonos Voice Control is more limited than Alexa or Siri, all commands are processed locally.\nOf course, there are new lights coming, too. The page reveals a new, more energy-efficient E26/A19 60-watt smart bulb that uses 40 percent less energy and dims as low as 0.2. percent. It supports Hue’s ChromaSync tech for more precise color matching when syncing across fixtures — a feature also coming to a new “family of indoor and outdoor light strips” with gradient lighting.\nTwo new Festavia-branded outdoor lights are on the way: a set of permanent outdoor lights designed to be fixed to the outside of your house, similar to those offered by Govee and Nanoleaf, and a set of Globe String lights. The globe lights look particularly attractive, with each bulb featuring a “distinctive inner tube” that can be customized with light gradients, colors, and special effects. \nIt’s an impressive lineup, but the upgraded bridge with motion-sensing technology is the standout. Not only should it strengthen Hue’s lighting system and support more devices, it could eliminate the need for dedicated motion sensors altogether. I’ll be in Berlin next month for IFA to see the official launch and get hands-on with these new products.",

      "raw": "ChatGPT head Nick Turley says it’s “good to preserve optionality.”\t\n\nOpenAI is considering ways to bring in additional revenue, and bringing ads to ChatGPT is one option on the table. While being interviewed on Decoder, ChatGPT head Nick Turley said he’s “humble enough not to rule it out categorically,” but hedged that OpenAI would need to “be very thoughtful and tasteful” about how ads could be integrated into ChatGPT.\n“We will build other products, and those other products can have different dimensions to them, and maybe ChatGPT just isn’t an ads-y product because it’s just so deeply accountable to your goals. But it doesn’t mean that we wouldn’t build other things in the future, too,” Turley said. “I think it’s good to preserve optionality, but I also really do want to emphasize how incredible the subscription model is, how fast it’s growing, and how untapped a lot of the opportunities are.”\nBloomberg reported in March that OpenAI is expecting to generate $12.7 billion in revenue this year through subscriptions, more than triple the $3.7 billion in annual revenue it reportedly generated in 2024. The company still burns more money than it makes, however, and isn’t expecting to be cash-flow positive until 2029. Turley says that ChatGPT just surpassed 700 million total users. According to the last figures reported in April, the service has 20 million paid subscribers.\n“I actually don’t view the fact that the vast majority of our users are free as necessarily a liability,” Turley said. “I really think it’s a funnel that we can build off of to build differentiated offerings for people who are willing to pay.”\n\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed mixed feelings about bringing ads to the company’s flagship chatbot. While at a fireside chat at Harvard Business School last year, Altman said that merging ads with AI is “sort of uniquely unsettling to me” and would be considered a “last resort” for ChatGPT. On the first episode of OpenAI’s podcast in June, however, Altman said he’s “not totally against it.” These considerations come as Elon Musk-owned rival xAI has firmer plans to include ads in Grok’s responses in the future.\nAnother way OpenAI is looking to build revenue is by taking a cut of product purchases via ChatGPT recommendations. Turley says this is “something we are actively exploring with some of the merchants we’re talking to,” and that the project is called “Commerce in ChatGPT.” Not allowing affiliate revenue to influence ChatGPT product recommendations is a focus for OpenAI, according to Turley.\n“All the demos that we have in this space internally make this extremely clear,” Turley said. “I think the magic of ChatGPT is that it independently chooses your products without any interference, and that would be an important thing to preserve.”\nFor the full interview, go and listen to the latest episode of Decoder.",

You can stick it to the back of your iPhone to keep it charged when you don’t have access to power, but rotating the K1 90 degrees reveals a second built-in wireless charger so you can simultaneously charge an Apple Watch or AirPods with a charging case that supports that feature.\nThe K1 3-in-1 MagSafe Wireless Power Bank is currently available from Kuxiu’s website in a 5,000mAh version that’s discounted from $99.99 to $57.99, or a slightly thicker but more capacious 10,000mAh version that’s discounted from $109.99 to $67.99. It can charge a MagSafe-compatible iPhone at 15W speeds (the iPhone 16 lineup can wirelessly charge at 25W using Apple’s latest MagSafe charger) while the Apple Watch and AirPods charge at 5W.\nIf you’re in a rush, the K1 also includes a USB-C port that can deliver 20W of power to your phone, earbuds, or any device that can be powered up with a USB-C cable. On the back you’ll also find a pop-out kickstand so the power bank can prop up your devices while they charge, and while it features a ring of 16 strong magnets to hold it securely to your iPhone, Kuxiu recommends avoiding thick phone cases and sticking to MagSafe-compatible options to reduce the risk of the K1 falling off.",
