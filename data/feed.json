      "raw": "The AI web search company Perplexity is being hit by another lawsuit alleging copyright and trademark infringement, this time from Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster. Britannica, the centuries-old publisher that owns Merriam-Webster, sued Perplexity in New York federal court on September 10th.\nIn the lawsuit, the companies allege that Perplexity’s “answer engine” scrapes their websites, steals their internet traffic, and plagiarizes their copyrighted material. Britannica also alleges trademark infringement when Perplexity attaches the two companies’ names to hallucinated or incomplete content. \nThe word “plagiarize” illustrates the point of the lawsuit. The court document includes back-to-back screenshots that show Perplexity’s result is identical to Merriam-Webster’s definition. \nPerplexity positions itself as a Google Search competitor. It has been called a “bullshit machine” that steals and recreates original content without proper citations. The AI company is also accused of “stealth crawling” websites with crawler blockers, a practice used by other AI companies.  \nPerplexity, backed by investors like Jeff Bezos, has tussled with other media outlets like Forbes, The New York Times, and the BBC. News Corp, the parent company of outlets like The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, sued Perplexity in October 2024.\nSome media companies joined Perplexity’s ad revenue sharing program, including Time magazine and the Los Angeles Times. Another popular encyclopedia, World History Encyclopedia, joined Perplexity’s publisher program, and on September 8th, it launched a Perplexity-powered AI chatbot that allows users to sift through the encyclopedia’s database of sources and academic articles. \nView Link",

      "raw": "Tyler Robinson, apprehended last night in connection to the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, allegedly left engraved bullets at the crime scene that were covered in a furry meme, a reference from the video game Helldivers 2, and an extremely online taunt.\nIn an FBI briefing this morning about his arrest, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox described the sequence of events that led to the capture of Robinson, 22, who was turned into the police by his father. They also clarified the nature of the notes engraved on the bullet casings found at the scene, which had been rumored to be slogans relating to antifascist and “transgender ideology.” As it turns out, the messages are a confusing mix of internet memes and pop culture.\nAs described, the bullets read (exact capitalization not confirmed at this point):\n“Notices bulges OWO what’s this?”\n“Hey fascist! Catch!” Up arrow symbol, right arrow, three down arrow symbols\n“Oh bella ciao bella ciao bella ciao ciao ciao”\n“If you read this, you are gay lmao”\nThe first bullet casing, which was fired, is a meme referring to furry online roleplay, according to Know Your Meme.\nIt’s not hard to see where the “antifascist” conclusion came from on two of the other bullets: “Bella ciao” is an Italian song adopted by partisans and resistance fighters while Italy was governed by the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Cox said in response to a question during the conference that the “hey fascist” message “speaks for itself.” Three downward-slanting arrows are a symbol used by both historical and contemporary antifascists.\nBut the full arrow sequence was quickly recognized as something else: a combo from Helldivers 2 for calling the Eagle 500kg Bomb stratagem. The world of Helldivers — which evokes Robert Heinlein’s book Starship Troopers and the subsequent movie — concerns fascism thematically; developer Arrowhead has characterized it as a satire where players fight for a fascist state.\nAs for the use of “Bella ciao,” the song has no obvious connection but given its historical significance, unsurprisingly does appear in a Helldivers 2 mod, as well as in at least one other video game, a World War II-themed strategy game called Hearts of Iron IV.\nThe fatal shooting of Kirk on Wednesday led to an intense manhunt across Utah, though it encountered numerous complications along the way. Several leads, publicly teased by FBI Director Kash Patel, quickly petered out. Leaked documents from law enforcement published by MAGA influencers led to false narratives about how markings on the bullet indicated that the shooter was in favor of “transgender ideology.” \nIt was nearly impossible to divorce politics and internet misinformation from Kirk’s death, however. The 31-year-old was a powerful figure in the MAGA movement, as the founder and leader of the right-wing college group Turning Point USA, and a prominent podcaster and MAGA influencer himself, famous for appearing on college campuses to confront liberal students. President Donald Trump credited Kirk and TPUSA as a factor in his return to office, and frequently relied on him as an emissary to youth voters. \n\nThe messages on the shooter’s bullet casings can best be described as bizarre and extremely online\n\n\nIn the aftermath of Kirk’s death, his allies in the MAGA movement, including lawmakers and influencers, promised swift retribution against the left should the killer share their ideology. The themes of Helldivers 2 could have an ideological meaning, albeit not necessarily a straightforward one. But ultimately, the messages on the shooter’s bullet casings can best be described as bizarre and extremely online. \nAccording to the FBI, evidence leading to Robinson’s arrest included screenshots from his roommate’s Discord chat, in which he mentioned leaving a rifle wrapped in a towel in some bushes. Law enforcement recovered a Mauser .30-06 from an area near the campus that was wrapped in a towel. \nFans of the game immediately noticed. Shortly after the press conference on Friday morning, the Helldivers subreddit was flooded with players who had picked up on what may be references to the game. A thread, now deleted, was titled: “Hey Facist Catch!” with the poster asking, “Did anyone else hear/notice?!” A commenter, responding to the thread, said, “The moment I heard [the arrows] my eyes widened.”\nAnother thread, also apparently deleted by moderators, referenced the arrows that authorities say were on one of the unfired bullet casings recovered at the scene. “It sickens me having people like this playing this game and using it to real violence to tarnish this awesome game and community,” the poster wrote. Other posts implored the subreddit moderators to lock down the forum. Moderators for the subreddit didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A thread in the separate r/Helldivers2 subreddit remains active, with people discussing the apparent parallels.\nArrowhead, the maker of the Helldivers games, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "raw": "Apple’s new smartwatches have the spotlight this week, but Android users have a reason to celebrate, too. That’s because Samsung’s gorgeous, Bluetooth-enabled Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is cheaper than ever at Woot through September 19th. It’s down to $359.99 ($140 off), nearly matching the price of the $349.99 Galaxy Watch 8. Not a bad discount for a watch that came out fewer than two months ago.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (Bluetooth)\nSamsung’s latest smartwatch features a new squircle design, Gemini, and some new health features like an Antioxidant Index and Running Coach. The Classic model adds a premium design complete with a rotating bezel, an extra customizable button, and longer battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499.99 $359.99 at Woot\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is our top pick for Samsung phone owners, particularly if you’re upgrading from a Galaxy Watch 5 or earlier. The Classic model builds on the Galaxy Watch 8’s improvements  with a more stylish and premium design, plus longer battery life, and the return of the beloved rotating bezel. It also inherits the Galaxy Watch Ultra’s Quick Button, which you can customize to launch your favorite app or workout.\nBeyond that, it’s identical to the Galaxy Watch 8, offering a thin squircle design that’s more comfortable to wear than its predecessor without sacrificing battery life. It monitors your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and can even take an EKG or detect sleep apnea when paired with a Samsung Galaxy phone. The wearable also debuts Running Coach, our favorite new fitness feature which tests your performance and creates a personalized workout plan based on your results. Plus, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic can even recommend your optimal bedtime based on your circadian rhythm and gauge your fruits and vegetables intake, though admittedly not always reliably.\nOn the smarts side, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic ships with One UI 8 Watch, which adds Google Gemini. You can ask it for nearby coffee shop recommendations, to send Slack messages, create playlists, and more. Given that it’s still early days for Gemini, results can be mixed, but hopefully it continues to improve. \nUnfortunately, the wearable only comes in a 46mm size, which might be too big for your taste. Still, if you’re a Samsung phone owner looking for a premium wearable, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is one of the best options available, especially now that it costs about the same as the standard model.\nRead our Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 review.\nA few more deals to wrap up the week\nThe tiny Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go is available at Amazon for $22.99 ($11 off), which is $3 shy of its all-time low. This colorful Bluetooth speaker offers good value for the price, with an IPX67 waterproof rating and the ability to float in water. It can last up to 20 hours on a single charge, and can produce stereo sound when paired with another Select 4 Go.\nWhisker’s Litter Robot 4 is on sale with a three-year warranty for $699 ($100) directly from the company’s website. The litter box essentially cleans itself after it has been used, rotating to dump waste into a drawer, and sending alerts when it needs to be emptied. It also helps neutralize unwanted odors and is suitable for up to four cats per unit. Plus, the companion app lets you monitor your cat’s weight, track litter and waste drawer levels, and more.\nYou can grab the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 for $199.99 at Amazon, Walmart, and Target, which is a great deal even if it’s $20 shy of their all-time low. The fitness-centric earbuds are some of the best on the market, offering heart rate monitoring (move over, AirPods Pro 3), secure ear hooks for intense workouts, and IPX4 water resistance. They also deliver great active noise cancellation, a natural-sounding transparency mode, and native support for some Android and Apple features like automatic device switching. Read our review.",

Up until now, The Pokémon Company has been teasing and revealing new megas one by one with a series of inspired ad campaigns.

In fact, it looks a little bit like Minecraft — and it’s called Pokémon Pokopia.\nThe game has players controlling a Ditto that has taken on the form of a human, which means that it’s a little cute and also a little creepy. The goal of the game is to shape an empty landscape into a suitable home for some pokémon. That means taming the wilderness, growing crops, and also using a bunch of classic pokémon moves to make it all happen. The visuals look like a mix of the structured form of a Minecraft game with the cutesy characters and tone of Pokémon. Given those are two of the biggest franchises in gaming, it sounds — on paper at least — like a winning mix.\nPokopia is launching on the Nintendo Switch some time in 2026.",

It features Melinoë, Hades II’s protagonist and sister to Zagreus, the prince of hell who spent the first game trying to escape it. This time, Melinoë isn’t trying to leave hell, but break in to deal death to her grandfather, the god of time Chronos. As in Hades, Melinoë is aided in her quest by the gods, heroes of mythology, and the death-dealing power of her own two hands. \nHades II has been in early access on PC for a little over a year now. The game has undergone several chunky updates, slowly adding new content and weapons in the lead-up to its full release. According to the Direct, Hades II will launch on Switch, Switch 2, and PC on September 25th with a physical release launching in November. No word yet on when it’ll come to Xbox and PlayStation.",
