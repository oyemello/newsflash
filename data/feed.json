We’re expecting a major redesign to the cameras and looking forward to an entirely new addition to the lineup: the extra-thin iPhone 17 Air.\nAlongside the new iPhones, Apple is likely to update its Apple Watch line. This should be a bumper year, too, with the Apple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3 all making appearances, revamping Apple’s whole wearable line in one swoop. New AirPods Pro 3 should round out the launch, potentially adding heart rate monitoring for the first time.\nEverything kicks off at 1PM ET / 10AM PT today, September 9th, and you can watch the event right here:\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAre you excited about a thinner iPhone?\n\t\t\t\nThe iPhone 17’s potential makeover might be just enough\n\t\t\t\nApple iPhone 17 launch event: What to expect",

Its new “Megablock” is pre-engineered; more assembly done in a factory allows for 23 percent faster installation, according to Tesla. That’s supposed to translate to up to 40 percent lower construction costs.\nIt’s essentially supposed to be a plug-and-play platform, incorporating hardware and software services, to help utilities quickly meet rising electricity demands from data centers, electrified homes and vehicles, and manufacturing. \nThe Megablock incorporates Megapack 3, the latest iteration of Tesla’s battery storage system that the company also debuted at the same event. The latest Megapack has a “drastically simplified” thermal bay with 78 percent fewer connections to minimize failure points, Tesla said at the event and on X, and uses “the Tesla Model Y heat pump essentially on steroids.” \n\n\nMegapack is our utility-scale energy storage platform, a key part of our mission to achieve sustainable abundance via sustainable energy.@Tesla_Megapack stores energy when production is high & discharges/releases it when the grid needs it – balancing renewables & supporting a… https://t.co/CGXfALsUSG\n— Tesla (@Tesla) September 9, 2025\n\n\nThe Megapack 3 will be manufactured in Houston starting late next year, the company added.

      "raw": "Hyundai is out with a new concept car that previews a smaller EV that could slot below the Ioniq 5. And while the design is pretty bold, and full of what seems to be veiled references to Star Wars, the idea of a smaller (and hopefully less expensive) electric hatchback is surely one of the more grounded ways to approach a design exercise of this kind. \nThe Concept Three certainly hints at a possible Ioniq 3 somewhere down the line. And spec sheet certainly supports that inference, with dimensions — 168.8-inch length, 76.4-inch width, and 56.2-inch — that puts it squarely in that Kia Soul/Volkswagen Golf territory. Those numbers could change as this vehicle gets closer to production, but it seems like a sure bet that Hyundai is interested in a compact hatchback to help round out its Ioniq lineup, which right now includes the Ioniq 5 crossover, Ioniq 6 sedan, and Ioniq 9 full-size SUV. \nBut that’s not why you’re reading this article. You saw the pictures of the Concept Three and you clicked because you want to know WTF is going on with this weird yellow-tinted glass space craft looking vehicle. I don’t blame you. Hyundai is the rare automaker these days that’s still having a bit of fun with its concepts, and I applaud them for it. \nThe interior is wild, from the sugary yellow and purple accents to the bizarre design choices (seatbelt through the headrest?) to the Easter egg references to a certain iconic science-fiction film scattered throughout. We’ll start there, with sideview cameras that looks like a cross between the Death Star and BB-8. The cockpit and center console seems inspired by a speeder bike. And there’s even an inscription on the rear bumper that reads “May the downforce be with you.”\nOf course, all of this is subtext. Hyundai isn’t making any direct reference to Star Wars in its press materials about the Concept Three (likely so it wouldn’t have to pay Disney for the rights). And we only noticed them ourselves after watching YouTube channel Electrifying’s video tour of the EV. I guess you could call them Easter eggs, but even that feels more intentional than it is. Still, discovering all these fun design quirks makes the overall design a lot more rewarding. \nBut despite referencing one of America’s greatest cultural products to ever exist, the eventual production version of this concept may never make it to these shores. Hyundai says the Concept Three “signals the brand’s planned expansion into the European compact EV market.” And that makes total sense: Europe is a better market for EVs, and a better market for small hatchbacks. The rest of us will just have to gaze across that vast ocean and hope for the best.",

      "raw": "These screenshots are two examples of vertical videos that Google generated using Veo 3’s updated features.\t\n\nGoogle has added support for 1080p resolution and vertical video formats to its Veo 3 AI video generator. According to the announcement on Google’s developer blog, both Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast — a faster, and more affordable version of the video model that produces lower-quality results — now allow users to generate videos in a 9:16 aspect ratio that’s better suited for content displayed on mobile devices and social media apps.\nThe blog says that vertical video support can be enabled by setting the aspectRatio parameter in API requests to 9:16, meaning this feature is specific to developers who are building apps that support Veo 3 video generation. The update also allows developers to set the resolution of generated videos to 1080p, up from the previous 720p limitation, though Neowin reports that this is currently only supported for 16:9 aspect ratio videos.\nGoogle says it’s also making Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast “stable and ready for scaled production use in the Gemini API,” and has made it more affordable for developers to generate videos using these tools. Generation through Veo 3 is now $0.40 per second, down from $0.75, and the Veo 3 Fast model has been cut to $0.15 per second, down from $0.40. Google showcased these updates in a couple of  example videos generated in Veo 3’s new vertical format, including a rock climber saying, “Veo 3 is now, like, 50 percent cheaper and higher quality, so go build.”\n\nThe support for vertical video formats isn’t entirely surprising, given Google announced in June that Veo 3 support will be added to YouTube Shorts “later this summer.” Giving developers access to support the format in their own apps means we will likely start seeing content generated through Veo 3 on more vertical video platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels, however, putting yet more AI slop in front of our eyeballs.",

      "raw": "If you’ve been eyeing a flip phone but have been put off by the price, now’s your chance to snag one at a serious discount. Motorola’s latest Razr is currently matching its all-time low price of $599.99 ($100 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Motorola’s online storefront, making what was already an affordable flip phone even cheaper.\nMotorola Razr 2005\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699.99 $599.99 at Amazon\n $699.99 $599.99 at Best Buy\n $699.99 $599.99 at Motorola\n\nThe 2025 Razr is a solid, relatively inexpensive entry point into the world of foldables. The clamshell-style device features a 3.6-inch cover screen that’s great for performing quick tasks, plus an internal OLED display that stretches to 6.9 inches when the phone is open. While neither display is quite as sharp or vibrant as the ones found in the pricier Razr Ultra, they stack up well considering the price.\nAdditionally, the latest Razr offers a titanium hinge and an IP48 rating, resulting in a more durable design compared to previous iterations. However, while the device is fully water-resistant, any dust or particle smaller than 1mm can potentially damage the hinge. It also features a midrange Mediatek Dimensity 7400X processor and a 4,500mAh battery, easily allowing for a full day of battery life.\nThe Razr won’t offer the same performance as something like the Google Pixel 9A, even if it typically costs $200 more, but that’s the tradeoff if you want a cheap(er) foldable. That said, it’s far more affordable than something like the newer Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, which starts at $899. That makes the $100 discount on the Razr even sweeter, and a great option if you’re looking to save some money.\nOther deals worth checking out\nThe 8BitDo Micro Bluetooth Gamepad is on sale starting at $21.99 ($3 off) at Amazon. The tiny Bluetooth controller is an excellent option for gaming on the go, and it’s small enough to fit in your pockets between sessions. It’s compatible with Android, the Nintendo Switch, and Raspberry Pi; it also works as a multitasking controller on Android, Windows, and iOS.\nThis year’s excellent Superman movie is already available to own on your preferred digital platform; however, if you’d rather own a physical copy, the Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD versions are up for grabs at Amazon ahead of their September 23rd release. Both versions are discounted, with the Blu-ray going for $24.95 (about $5 off) and the 4K release $29.95 (about $5 off). Read our review.\nRight now, you can get a two-pack of physical Brick keys for $106.20 (about $12 off) from Brick, encouraging you and a friend, partner, or family member to spend less time glued to your screen. Basically, the Brick uses a physical key and an app to block distracting apps, so you aren’t tempted to browse Instagram during a movie. In her review, our own Victoria Song noted that the Brick has some limitations, though she found it can make it easier to put your phone down, leading to healthier habits.",

For the plan to work, leaked files suggest, they needed a frontman who had some pull with the sheikhs. So they hired Boris Johnson.\nHis time as the UK’s prime minister had ended less than two years earlier and he had left parliament. But Johnson retained relationships cultivated during his time in power. The Boris Files, a cache of documents seen by the Guardian, suggest he has sought to harness these relationships for self-enrichment.\n Continue reading...",

The Gamestation Go is not only an accessible way for nostalgic gamers to enjoy retro titles, it also provides several ways to accurately play those older games with an unusual assortment of control options.\nIn addition to a standard D-pad and buttons, the Gamestation Go features a paddle controller, a trackball, and a numeric keypad, mirroring the unique controllers that were available for the earliest Atari consoles. The various controls even light up so you know which one you should be using for the game you’re playing. And although the handheld features a generous 7-inch screen, battery life is still estimated to be up to four or five hours.",

      "raw": "Don’t call it a comeback.\t\n\nCanon seems to be riding the TikTok digicam resurgence and is rereleasing a mid-2010s point-and-shoot — the PowerShot Elph 360 HS A. It’s mostly the same camera as the original Elph 360 HS, first launched in the very different world of 2016 and recently anointed the darling pocket camera of celebrities like Kendall Jenner and Dua Lipa. \nNow, in 2025, the “A” version of the PowerShot still has the same 20.2-megapixel CMOS sensor, Digic IV Plus processor, 12x optical zoom, 1080p video, and USB Mini port of the nine-year-old throwback. (Nope, no USB-C.) But the new model now costs $379 instead of the original’s $210, and it makes the switch to microSD cards instead of full-size SD.\nThe downsizing of features doesn’t end with storage formats. The new Elph incarnation doesn’t support Wi-Fi image transfers to a PC or direct printing via Wi-Fi like the original (though I’m skeptical many people were doing that). And there’s no longer a purple color, as the new Elph 360 HS A will only come in black or silver when it launches in late October.\nThe jump in price while downsizing in features sounds baffling at first. But the rising popularity of point-and-shoot cameras among younger folks and the trend of celebs being spotted using the original model has fueled a viral interest in the 360 HS. Canon never seemed to truly discontinue the original model, until now that the “A” is replacing it. The aging version can still occasionally be found at retailers, but often for hefty markups.\nAuthorized Canon dealer B&H Photo maintains a listing for it, priced at $359.99, though it’s currently “temporarily out of stock.” A live chat sales rep for B&H told me the store last received a shipment on August 14th, but much like with my colleague Allison Johnson’s efforts to procure a Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark III earlier this year, these “drops” get quickly snatched up.\nAs much as I find the digicam trend endearing (I think it’s fun for young people to explore new-old creative avenues and breathe fresh life into outdated tech), it will be interesting to see a big company like Canon try to meet this viral moment. I usually feel that once the suits catch wind of these things and want to cash in, it’s time to pack it up and move on to the next cool thing. The digicam trend may still last a while longer, but what happens if Canon makes enough of the new 360 HS A cameras that they’re readily available at MSRP? Will the interest remain if the camera is no longer a hard-to-get flex for online clout, like a Labubu?\nWhat’s an Elph? Does it have pointy ears?\nThe PowerShot Elph 360 HS was released as the Ixus 285 HS in Europe and Ixy 650 in Japan. Canon has often given its consumer cameras different names in different regions. For example, the older Canon EOS SLRs were branded EOS Rebel / Digital Rebel in the US, while they had just alphanumeric names in Europe and were known as Kiss / Kiss Digital in Japan.",
