      "raw": "You can currently get an Apple Watch for $649.99 ($150 off).\t\n\nIf you’re interested in a long-lasting smartwatch, and like to stay within Apple’s hardware ecosystem, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is the best choice. It’s Apple’s most durable, longest-lasting smartwatch, and it’s currently on sale for $649.99 ($150 off), an all-time low price at Amazon and Best Buy. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in a single case size (49mm), material (titanium), and configuration (GPS + Cellular), so the only choice you have to make is which band best fits your style.\nApple Watch Ultra 2\nThe rugged Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in one size: 49mm. It offers the brightest display of any wearable in Apple’s lineup, along with better battery life and improved performance. It sports Apple’s new S9 SiP, too, allowing you to take advantage of Apple’s new double tap feature. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $649 at Amazon\n $799 $649 at Best Buy\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2’s battery lasted roughly two and a half days in our tests, and Apple says you can get up to 72 hours with low power mode enabled. If you have the right accessories, you can charge the Apple Watch Ultra 2 from zero to 80 percent in under an hour. The smartwatch’s S9 SiP processor is powerful enough to handle on-device Siri queries, and enables the double tap gesture, which allows you to scroll or interact with buttons on its display by tapping your fingers instead of the screen. Apple introduced the S10 SiP with the Apple Watch Series 10 last year, but the Apple Watch Ultra 2’s processor is still plenty powerful. \nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 supports several health and wellness features, including sleep apnea detection, fall detection, crash detection, sleep tracking, and heart tracking. The watch will send you a notification if it detects atrial fibrillation, and allows you to take an EKG (electrocardiogram) on device. Apple recently re-enabled the Apple Watch’s ability to monitor your blood oxygen level, though you’ll need to review the readings within your iPhone’s health app. When you exercise, you can select from a list of dozens of workout types to accurately log your fitness routine. \nApple has traditionally announced Apple Watch hardware updates at its iPhone event typically held in September, and rumors suggest the Apple Watch Ultra 3 will have a larger display, but the Ultra 2 is an excellent choice at its sale price.\nThree more great deals \nIf you need a small Bluetooth speaker to take to the beach, Soundcore Select 4 Go is down to $24.99 ($10 off) at Amazon. Its IP67 rating means it shouldn’t get damaged after being submerged under a meter of water for up to half an hour. However, the speaker is designed to float safely for a limited amount of time, so it shouldn’t stay under the surface for long. Soundcore says the Select 4 Go can last up to 20 hours per charge. Its built-in handle makes it easy to carry, and allows you to easily attach it to a backpack using a carabiner. \nAura’s Mason 9 is a Wi-Fi-enabled digital picture frame that makes it easy to display your favorite photos in a common area, and it’s $119.99 ($80 off) at Woot. Once the frame is connected to the internet, you can send photos and videos to Aura’s servers via app on your smartphone. The Mason 9 will cycle through the pictures and videos you’ve uploaded. Aura says you can upload an unlimited number of photos and videos to the server without paying a subscription fee.\nEufy’s Omni S1 Pro is a powerful robot vacuum and mop combo that takes most of the hard work out of keeping your floors clean, and it’s currently $949.99 ($550 off) at Amazon. The vacuum uses LiDAR sensors to create an accurate map of the rooms in your house, and will create a route to clean them as efficiently as possible. The Omni S1 Pro can clean both hard flooring and carpets, and will automatically empty dirty water and its dust bag into containers within its charging base. If you connect the Omni S1 Pro to the internet, you can set up a custom cleaning schedule, or start and stop a cleaning remotely.",

      "raw": "Anthropic’s Claude AI chatbot can now end conversations deemed “persistently harmful or abusive,” as spotted earlier by TechCrunch. The capability is now available in Opus 4 and 4.1 models, and will allow the chatbot to end conversations as a “last resort” after users repeatedly ask it to generate harmful content despite multiple refusals and attempts at redirection. The goal is to help the “potential welfare” of AI models, Anthropic says, by terminating types of interactions in which Claude has shown “apparent distress.”\nIf Claude chooses to cut a conversation short, users won’t be able to send new messages in that conversation. They can still create new chats, as well as edit and retry previous messages if they want to continue a particular thread.\nDuring its testing of Claude Opus 4, Anthropic says it found that Claude had a “robust and consistent aversion to harm,” including when asked to generate sexual content involving minors, or provide information that could contribute to violent acts and terrorism. In these cases, Anthropic says Claude showed a “pattern of apparent distress” and a “tendency to end harmful conversations when given the ability.”\nAnthropic notes that conversations triggering this kind of response are “extreme edge cases,” adding that most users won’t encounter this roadblock even when chatting about controversial topics. The AI startup has also instructed Claude not to end conversations if a user is showing signs that they might want to hurt themselves or cause “imminent harm” to others. Anthropic partners with Throughline, an online crisis support provider, to help develop responses to prompts related to self-harm and mental health.\nLast week, Anthropic also updated Claude’s usage policy as rapidly advancing AI models raise more concerns about safety. Now, the company prohibits people from using Claude to develop biological, nuclear, chemical, or radiological weapons, as well as to develop malicious code or exploit a network’s vulnerabilities.",

      "raw": "MSNBC is about to look a lot — and sound — a lot different. The cable news network will soon go by My Source News Opinion World (MS NOW) and drop its peacock logo, as reported earlier by Deadline.\nThe change comes as Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, plans to spin off its cable business, including networks like MSNBC, CNBC, USA, Oxygen, and E!, into a new company called Versant. In a memo seen by The Verge, MSNBC president Rebecca Kutler told staffers that as part of the transition, NBCUniversal decided that MSNBC needed “a new, separate identity.”\nMSNBC originally launched in 1996 as a joint venture between Microsoft and NBC News, though the tech giant sold its majority stake in the network in 2005 and ended its web partnership in 2012. The network has used the peacock logo associated with NBC for nearly three decades. Additionally, CNBC will keep its name but drop the peacock logo as well.\nKutler added that the rebrand won’t affect MSNBC’s coverage. “The future of our success is not tied to remaining within the NBC family and using the peacock as part of our identity,” Kutler wrote. “While our name will be changing, who we are and what we do will not.”\nHere’s Kutler’s memo in full:\nAll, \nFollowing up on what you may have already seen from Mark, later this year, we will take on a new name: MS NOW, which stands for My Source for News, Opinion,and the World.\nThis new branding underscores our mission: to serve as a destination for breaking news and best-in-class opinion journalism, all rooted in accurate and reported facts. \nI know this announcement will be met with questions, and I want to acknowledge that for many of you who have spent years or decades here, it is hard to imagine the network by any other name. This was not a decision that was made quickly or without significant debate. \nOver the last eight months, we have worked to untether ourselves from NBC News and embrace our independence under VERSANT. We’ve hired dozens of first-rate reporters and newsroom leaders and have been recruiting for nearly 100 roles across our new and nimble organization. We continue to supercharge our non-linear products, achieving rapid success on YouTube, TikTok, audio, digital, live events, and more – all while aggressively developing a direct-to-consumer product. \nDuring this time of transition, NBCUniversal decided that our brand requires a new, separate identity. This decision now allows us to set our own course and assert our independence as we continue to build our own modern newsgathering operation.\nThe future of our success is not tied to remaining within the NBC family and using the peacock as part of our identity. While our name will be changing, who we are and what we do will not. Our commitment to our work and our audiences will not waiver from what the brand promise has been for three decades. \nIn conjunction with the brand relaunch, we will be making a significant investment in a broad-based marketing campaign, unlike anything we have done in recent memory. Planning is now underway for an employee all-hands meeting next week, where I will have more to share – more news on that soon. \nUntil then, we have millions of people who rely on us to continue doing what we do best. As I said on my first day, our most important job is to show up for our audience, the community that is depending on us now more than ever.\nRebecca\nDisclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.",

The specialized AI agents are available in docs — which is Grammarly’s new “AI-native writing surface,” according to the company’s press release — at no extra cost for Grammarly Free and Pro users.\n“Students today need AI that enhances their capabilities without undermining their learning,” said Jenny Maxwell, Head of Grammarly for Education. “Grammarly’s new agents fill this gap, acting as real partners that guide students to produce better work while ensuring they develop real skills that will serve them throughout their careers. By teaching students how to work effectively with AI now, we’re preparing them for a workplace where AI literacy will be essential.”\nOne of the most notable tools is the AI grader agent, which Grammarly says can provide feedback based on uploaded course details and “publicly available” information about the instructor. The bot can give tailored writing recommendations and estimate what grade the paper will receive in its current state, helping students make improvements prior to submission.\nStudents can use other Grammarly AI agents to improve their writing, including the reader reactions agent that predicts what questions readers may have after reading the paper, the proofreader agent that provides in-line writing suggestions, and the paraphrase agent that adjusts writing to suit specific tones, audiences, and styles. For help with attribution and sourcing, Grammarly is releasing a citation finder agent that automatically generates correctly formatted citations backing up claims in a piece of writing, and an expert review agent that provides personalized, topic-specific feedback.\nWhile these tools are primarily focused at helping students to write papers, Grammarly is also releasing two tools that can help educators review them. Grammarly says its plagiarism checker agent can scan “vast databases, academic papers, websites, and published works” to detect any similarities with writing submissions. An AI detector agent is also available that provides a score to indicate the likelihood of the text being written by a human or AI-generated.\nThe AI and plagiarism detector agents are only available to Grammarly Pro users at launch. Grammarly says it will bring all of the AI agents it’s launching today to Enterprise and Education users “later this year,” alongside new agents that will be announced at a future date.",

      "raw": "Microsoft first introduced a dark mode option in Windows 10 in 2016, but there were still plenty of areas of the operating system that looked like a mish-mash of light and dark modes. Nearly a decade later, the latest preview build of Windows 11 now includes even more darkened UI elements.\nWindows watcher Phantomofearth spotted updated file operation dialogs with a dark theme. If you’re copying files or deleting them, these dialogs will finally have a dark mode instead of light-themed prompt. It’s clearly a work in progress though, as the buttons on these prompts still have light buttons instead of dark ones.\n\n\nWindows 11's file operation (copy, access denied, etc.) dialogs are FINALLY getting support for dark mode! Here's how the dialogs look in dark mode at this point, hidden in build 26100.5061.\nAlso notice the light buttons in the top right, still a work in progress of course. pic.twitter.com/3D00lWIJcn\n— phantomofearth 🌳 (@phantomofearth) August 15, 2025\n\n\nMicrosoft hasn’t officially announced any improvements to its Windows 11 dark mode, but these small changes could indicate a broader overhaul is coming in time for the 25H2 update later this year. The Control Panel, Run prompt, and file properties UI are all still stuck in light mode, so hopefully Microsoft finds the time after nearly 10 years to address these, too.\nI’m not holding out much hope, though. It took Microsoft a few years to even add a dark mode to File Explorer in Windows 10, after the OS shipped with a mixture of light and dark modes. Apple has long had a consistent dark mode in macOS, since it shipped with macOS Mojave in 2018. A new Liquid Glass redesign is even on the way later this year, with a bigger focus on translucency.",
