For the first time, the Ear 3’s charging case will also feature a microphone called the Super Mic, and a dedicated “talk” button.\nThe company says it’s introducing metal components on the Ear 3 “for greater durability and a premium finish,” and that it has “reengineered the metal antenna” in the earbuds to achieve an ultra-slim design. Unfortunately, details about what the charging case’s microphone and talk button can be used for, as well as performance details about the new wireless earbuds, won’t be revealed until September 18th, 2025 at 8AM ET.\nOver the past week Nothing has shared additional teaser images of the Ear 3 through its X account, but the close-up photos have only revealed fine design details so far. The talk button and microphone are interesting additions, but it’s not known exactly how they’ll be used.

      "raw": "A UK-based video game reseller claims Sega was behind a police raid that seized a trove of Nintendo development kits from his home, according to a report from Time Extension. The seller, who reportedly purchased the collection from a scrapyard, accuses Sega of getting the police involved to recover the dev kits after mistakenly throwing them out.\nThe seller tells the outlet that he purchased the rare finds for around £10,000 (~$13,526) from a worker who showed up at the scrapyard with “a van-load of items that had reportedly come from Sega’s office clearance.” Sega moved its Europe office from Brentford, West London, to the city’s Chiswick Business Park earlier this year.\nOn July 14th — around three months after the purchase — police arrested the seller and raided his home, according to Time Extension. “I was woken at around 7:30 am by a loud knock at my door,” the seller tells Time Extension. “When I opened it, I was met by approximately ten officers from the City of London Police. They informed me that I was under arrest for money laundering and that they were there to seize development kits and game cartridges.”\nIn addition to Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DSi, 2DS, 3DS, Wii, and Wii U dev kits, the collection also included a bunch of prototype games, including Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood, Sonic Generations, Mario & Sonic at the Winter Olympic Games, Phantasy Star 0, and many others. It’s unclear whether the games  were seized by police.\nJust days after releasing the seller, police reportedly asked him to sign a “formal disclaimer request” that asks him to relinquish ownership of the dev kits, indicating that he fairly obtained the consoles. The seller hasn’t heard back from the police after refusing to sign the disclaimer, nor has Sega reached out to him despite being “named in six separate pre-action protocol claims,” he tells Time Extension. \nThe rare consoles are still in the hands of the police, and it’s unclear whether they’ll ever see the light of day, sparking frustration from the video game preservation community. The Verge reached out to Sega with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.",

Starting in October, all three will be available for all Microsoft 365 Copilot users at no extra cost from the Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Store.\nThis move takes the price of most of Microsoft’s top AI tools down to $30 per user per month, instead of the $50 per user per month some businesses had to pay for Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot for Sales, Service, and Finance together.\nMicrosoft is positioning this internally as a way to simplify its Copilot subscriptions for businesses, while it pushes ahead with more AI agents inside its productivity suite. Agent 365, which is due to be announced at Microsoft Ignite according to sources, is being developed as a set of tools to manage AI agents and ensure the security and compliance requirements of businesses are met.\nMicrosoft is also reportedly planning to use Anthropic’s AI models for some features in Microsoft 365. The Information reports that the Microsoft 365 Copilot will be “partly powered by Anthropic models,” after Microsoft found that some of these models outperformed OpenAI in Excel and PowerPoint. It’s a surprise move, especially given that Microsoft will reportedly pay Anthropic for access to its models through AWS. It’s also a big admission that OpenAI’s GPT-5 model has been disappointing, compared to some of Claude Sonnet 4’s features.",

What was on the menu? Shrimp, reportedly. The company, an arm of Jack Ma-backed Ant Group, has also been parading the human-shaped bot at the 2025 Inclusion Conference this week in Shanghai, according to Bloomberg.\nHelping out in the kitchen is the first of many potential use cases for R1, Robbyant says. The company, also known as Shanghai Ant Lingbo Technology Co., says the bot could be used as a companion or caregiver robot in healthcare, or as a robotic tour guide in the travel industry. \nThe company has not announced a launch date or price point for the bot and is reportedly testing it in community centers and restaurants. It would be wise to view claims of R1’s performance skeptically until the bot can be seen acting on its own in the real world, though this video from IFA doesn’t set expectations too high, as R1 places a box on a counter at a pace so glacial it makes a sloth seem speedy:\n\nAnt joins the likes of Elon Musk’s Tesla in doubling down on AI-powered robotics. While the field has been plagued with hyped-up promises and underwhelmingly slow progress on even basic tasks for decades, many believe that software advances will finally help the field overcome decades of slow and deeply underwhelming progress.",

      "raw": "Charlie Kirk, the influencer and activist who co-founded right-wing group Turning Point USA, has died at the age of 31 after being shot while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University, according to his spokesperson Andrew Kolvet, speaking to the New York Times. Deseret News had earlier reported Kirk’s death, according to Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, and President Donald Trump said Kirk is dead in a post on Truth Social at 4:40PM ET.\nAt a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said that “we have a person of interest in custody,” minutes after FBI Director Kash Patel tweeted an announcement that “The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody.”\nJust before 8PM ET, Kash tweeted again, saying, “The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement. Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency.”\nFollowing the shooting, videos on social media seemed to show the arrest of an alleged suspect. Utah Valley University initially said that a suspect was in custody, but Deseret News reported that, according to officials, the status of the shooter is unclear. A spokesperson has also told the New York Times that a person taken into custody after the shooting was not actually the shooter.\n\nAccording to media reports, he appeared to have been hit in the neck. A spokesperson for the university, Ellen Treanor, said in a statement that “shots were fired from a building about 200 yards from the speaker.” The school later said its campus will be closed through Sunday, September 14th.\nUtah Valley University:\nOn behalf of Utah Valley University, we are shocked and saddened by the tragic passing of Charlie Kirk, a guest to our campus. Our hearts go out to his family. As we grieve with our students, faculty, and staff who bore witness to this unspeakable tragedy, UVU campuses will be closed from September 11-14.\nAt the time of the shooting, Kirk was speaking at the first event of a scheduled 15-stop American Comeback Tour, and seated at a “Prove Me Wrong Table” taking questions from the crowd, according to the New York Times.\nUpdate, September 10th: Added the latest information about a person of interest who was interrogated and released.",

We’ve reached out to some of the platforms to ask how they will be treating the videos and charged posts about the shooting. So far, we’re aware of responses from Bluesky, Meta, Reddit, YouTube, and Discord\nBluesky:\n“Glorifying violence or harm violates Bluesky’s Community Guidelines,” Bluesky said on its Bluesky Safety account. “We review reports and take action on content that celebrates harm against anyone. Violence has no place in healthy public discourse, and we’re committed to fostering healthy, open conversations.”\nMeta:\nSpokesperson Francis Brennan referred The Verge to the company’s policies on violent and graphic content, which Brennan indicated would apply in this case. According to those policies, “we remove the most graphic content and add warning labels to other types of content so that people are aware it may be sensitive before they click through. We restrict the ability for younger users to see content that may not be suitable or age-appropriate for them. By doing so, we aim to provide an appropriate user experience, while continuing to provide space for our users to express themselves.”\nReddit:\n“Our sitewide rules prohibit encouraging, glorifying, inciting, or calling for violence,” spokesperson Gina Antonini tells The Verge. “We’re monitoring the platform to remove violating content, including hashing to prevent its re-upload. We have also reached out to ensure moderators understand and abide not only by the Reddit Rules, but also our Moderator Code of Conduct, and understand the tools and resources available to uphold our policies.”\nYouTube:\n“Our hearts are with Charlie Kirk’s family following his tragic death,” spokesperson Jack Malon tells The Verge. “We are closely monitoring our platform and prominently elevating news content on the homepage, in search and in recommendations to help people stay informed.”\nMalon says that YouTube will be removing “some graphic content” related to Kirk’s death, “particularly if it does not provide sufficient context for viewers.” Some content that shows the attack will be age-restricted, meaning that it can’t be seen by signed-out viewers or users under 18.\nMalon also says that YouTube’s policies prohibit content “reveling in or mocking the death or serious injury of an identifiable individual.”\nDiscord:\n“Discord’s Community Guidelines prohibit content that glorifies or promotes violence,“ spokesperson Jillian Susi writes to The Verge. “We are actively removing video and other content related to this incident that violates our policies and are committed to keeping Discord a positive and welcoming space.”\nTikTok and X didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from The Verge.\nUpdate, September 11th: Added statement from a Discord spokesperson.",

OpenAI’s contract will begin in 2027, according to the report. \nOpenAI, which reportedly expects $12.7 billion in revenue this year, is also likely behind another $10 billion contract with the semiconductor giant Broadcom to design its own AI chip.\nWhile reporting quarterly earnings on Tuesday, Oracle CEO Safra Catz announced that three unnamed companies had signed “four multi-billion-dollar contracts” in Q1, part of a trend that she said is increasing Oracle’s cloud infrastructure revenue by 77 percent this year. Overall, the company said that in Q1 it added more than $317 billion in future contract revenue, a massive dollar amount that sent share prices soaring and Chairman Larry Ellison to the top spot of the world’s richest person list.",
