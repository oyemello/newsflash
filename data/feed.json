      "raw": "The Nxtpaper 5G Junior ships with a choice of blue or orange case included.\t\n\nTCL has been making its E Ink-inspired Nxtpaper phones for years, but it’s taken the company until now to realize that parents are a likely demographic for it. That’s finally been remedied with the Nxtpaper 5G Junior, a kids phone launching in Europe with a focus on eye health and screentime, which arrives alongside the more mainstream Nxtpaper 60 Ultra.\nThe Nxtpaper 5G Junior has been announced at the IFA trade show, but it won’t go on sale in Europe until December and will cost £159 / €249 (around $250). It will also include a protective case. So far, there are no plans for a US launch.\nLike other recent Nxtpaper phones, the key selling point is a dedicated button that activates Max Ink Mode, which switches the matte display to a monochromatic mode that looks a lot like E Ink and is easier on the eyes for reading. The appeal to parents will be an extra way to manage screentime: not just a binary on / off, but an in-between option that’s better for kids’ eyes and not particularly well-suited to playing Fortnite. It extends the device’s battery life, too.\nThe phone includes a variety of parental controls powered by Google’s Family Link, along with a “Digital Detox” mode to encourage healthy phone use. TCL has also created a range of cutesy characters called the AI Genius Squad, which look like they’ve been lifted from a slightly subpar Pixar movie.\nOne immediate downside is that this is a pretty big phone. With a 6.7-inch screen and the included case, this will be a bulky, heavy device that might be a little tricky for smaller hands. It comes with 256GB of storage — enough for plenty of apps and games — and dual rear cameras.\nTCL is also launching the Nxtpaper 60 Ultra, the first phone to ship with the latest Nxtpaper 4.0 tech, with reduced glare and display flicker. It’s even bigger, with a 7.2-inch display and has a triple rear camera, including a 50-megapixel telephoto lens, plus optional stylus support. It’s launching today in Europe from €449 (around $525), as well as Asia and Latin America.",

It’s reminiscent of a similar wireless charger that Zens released last year, but Baseus’ new EnerGeek GT01 has additional functionality, including a 10,000mAh battery that can be separated from the adapter’s AC plug for use as a portable power bank and wireless charger, leaving behind a simple 27W USB-C charger still stuck in the wall.\nWireless charging is limited to Qi2 rates so your phone will only charge at 15W instead of the faster 25W that you’ll get from new Qi2.2 chargers. If you’re in a hurry to revive a dying phone, or want to charge a device that’s not Qi-compatible, the EnerGeek GT01 also has a USB-C port that outputs 45W on the device’s power bank half. The Qi2 pad and both USB-C ports can all be used simultaneously when the two halves are connected, but while wireless charging will maintain a steady 15W rate, the two USB ports will dynamically share the remaining available power.\nRounding out the novelties is a small LCD display on one side that shows the battery’s remaining charge level and an estimate of how many hours and minutes are left before it’s fully depleted based on what’s currently drawing power. \nIt’s expected to launch later this year for $89.99, which is a bit pricey for a 10,000mAh power bank — even with wireless charging capabilities (Anker has one for $60).

There’s automatic captioning, 4K HDR support, and one-tap exporting to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram — including automatic resizing that frames content for each platform.\nThe iOS version of Premiere will be free to download and use, though Adobe says there will be charges for additional cloud storage and generative AI credits. Speaking of, it includes support for Adobe’s generative sound effects and AI-powered speech enhancement, plus a wider range of AI assets generated through Adobe Firefly. If you’d rather not use AI content, there’s a selection of Adobe fonts, along with images, sounds, music, and video assets that are free to use.\nUntil now Adobe has only offered Premiere Rush on mobile, a simplified version of its video editor. The new Premiere promises something a little closer to the full Premiere Pro according to Mike Polner, vice president of creator product marketing, putting “pro-level creative control in your hands, without the pro-level complexity.”\n“With Premiere on iPhone, we’re bringing that same creative power that filmmakers, designers, animators, and YouTube creators use to produce hit commercials, iconic music videos, Oscar-winning films, and viral content to the most convenient place to move from capture to publish: your phone.”",

      "raw": "Eight years after breaking every record with an $800, 7,541-piece Star Wars Millennium Falcon, the Lego Group is introducing its first $1,000 set.\nIt’s an intricately detailed Death Star nearly two feet tall (52.3cm), a foot and a half wide (48cm) and over a foot (38.3cm) deep, with enough compartments to re-enact nearly every iconic Death Star scene from Star Wars and Return of the Jedi. \nWe’ve never seen a Lego set anywhere near this expensive. When the $999.99, €999.99 or £899.99 price and images leaked in July, many wondered how the Lego Group could possibly justify such a price for plastic toys!\nWell, I’m here to tell you the company has been doing better than ever — record revenue and record profits outpacing the whole toy industry — ever since it started catering to nostalgic, deep pocketed adults and letting its prices and piece counts climb.\n“$850 Millennium Falcons and $680 Titanics: Grown-Ups Are Now a Gold Mine for Lego,” The Wall Street Journal wrote last year. “Lego bricks have won over adults, growing its $10 billion toy market foothold,” added Fortune, writing that roughly 15 percent of Lego’s sets are aimed at adults. In my experience, that isn’t just because adults like to play with minifigs. Building is a relaxing diversion, a way to de-stress, and then you have a piece of home decor and a sense of accomplishment when you’re done.\nBut whether you’re looking for decor or a playset, this Death Star looks like an incredible one. \nInstead of offering a spherical Death Star like earlier, blockier playsets, the new Ultimate Collectors Series (UCS) Death Star is a vertical slice, a diorama set like the Batcave Shadowbox that can live on a shelf with all rooms visible at once.\n\nAlmost every iconic scene is accounted for here, from the hangar bay where Darth Vader and a squad of stormtroopers can greet the Emperor arriving in the included Imperial Shuttle, to the detention block AA-23 shootout and escape, to the garbage compactor scare, to the comms room where R2-D2 and C-3PO wait and helpfully shut that compactor down.\nMeanwhile, Vader can find a disturbing lack of faith in the conference room, Obi-Wan Kenobi can go tackle the tractor beam, while Luke and Leia swing across the chasm overhead; you get superlaser targeting and control rooms for Leia to give up Dantooine, and a turbolift to take minifigs to each of six different levels. Then, Luke can have his Return of the Jedi showdown with Vader and the Emperor and his Red Guards in his throne room at the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuke and Han can also be multiple places simultaneously: the 38 minifigures include both “aren’t you a little short for a Stormtrooper” and Return of the Jedi versions of Luke as well as his original outfit, plus Stormtrooper and traditional vest versions of Han. Lego says there’s even a stormtrooper in a hot tub as an easter egg.\nAs excited as I am, I’m afraid it’s too rich for my blood, but I won’t echo some complaints that Lego isn’t even giving us a full spherical Death Star for $1,000. \nI would prefer it this way, if it didn’t cost so much — because unlike the $850 Millennium Falcon, I could actually fit it in my home. Even though there isn’t enough room inside the hangar bay for a minifig-scale Millennium Falcon, or a full platoon of Stormtroopers, I can place them right next to this set and imagine they’re enclosed within — just like I’d imagine the rest of the Death Star’s reactor shaft after I send the Emperor over the railing to his doom.\nThe UCS Death Star will go up for sale on October 1st for Lego Insiders (it’s a free signup) or October 4th for everyone else. There’s a chance for Lego Insiders to win one starting today by spending 50 rewards points, and there’s a “while supplies last” promo gift for the first buyers: a “set with a Tie Fighter with Imperial Hanger Rack.”\nThe Death Star isn’t the biggest Lego set ever made — that’s the Art World Map or the Eiffel Tower or the Titanic, depending on how you measure — but it does have the most mini-figs.",

Previously limited access and only available by request, the verification badge is now open to any company with a Premium company page subscription.\nLinkedIn introduced verification in 2023, and the company says that more than 80 million users have verified themselves since then.

The changes are meant to address growing demand from athletes turning to Apple’s wearable, according to Strava:\nIn 2024, Strava saw a nearly 20 percent year-over-year increase in the share of device-uploading athletes using an Apple Watch, with Apple holding the top two spots for preferred devices among runners in Strava’s 2024 Year in Sport report. \nLive Segments are a Strava feature that provides real-time performance data on starred or popular sections of a route, allowing cyclists and runners to compete against themselves or others in an attempt to lay claim to King/Queen of the Mountain titles. The feature is already available on GPS-enabled watches and bike computers made by companies like Garmin, Hammerhead, Polar, and Suunto, so it’s good to see Apple finally join in on the motivational fun.\nWith the new app, athletes with an Apple Watch will be presented with a circle and banner showing the approaching segment. As they enter the segment, the circle updates in real time to reflect progress, and whether they are behind or ahead of their personal record. The results are shown at the end of the segment, before transitioning back to the standard recording screen.\n“Apple Watch has become an increasingly popular wearable for athletes on Strava,” said Strava’s chief product officer, Matt Salazar. “This investment in Apple Watch is more than just tracking a workout — it’s about delivering the real-time, game-like features athletes love to motivate them in the moment.”\nThe redesigned Strava Apple Watch app is available to download now, globally.",

      "raw": "PlayCube is a cross between a Rubik’s cube and TARS. | Image: TCL\t\n\nTCL is not a brand that typically elicits desire from me, yet here I am, looking at its IFA 2025 announcement of the PlayCube, wondering how a projector that pays homage to both a Rubik’s cube and TARS can fit into my life. The all-in-one Google TV projector with up to three hours of battery life — introduced as a concept in January — will be available to buy starting on September 5th. I’m just not sure it’s worth €799 (around $930), no matter how pretty it is.\nAs a long-time fan of cubes and The Verge’s resident vanlifer, TCL got my attention when it said the PlayCube was specifically designed for “camping projection.” I like that it’s Netflix-certified and that its quirky, twistable hardware lets you angle the image as needed, with built-in intelligence to automatically focus the image, avoid obstacles, align the image, and correct the keystone.\nHere’s a concept video with simulated images that show how the real projector might fit into your life.\n\nThe PlayCube measures just 5.9 x 3.8 x 3.8 inches, weighs 2.7 pounds, and features a glass lens and 1080p image lit by 750 ISO lumens — enough to create a tiny screen for casual viewing during the day and big-screen video at night. TCL says it produces less than 26 decibels of noise when running, which should easily be overcome by the projector’s lone 5W speaker or 3.5mm audio jack. Rounding out the specs are HDMI, USB, and Wi-Fi connectivity.",

That’s going by a photo of dummy phones shared by leaker and journalist Sonny Dickson, who has a pretty good track record for sourcing accurate Apple and Samsung phone designs.\nDickson’s photo shows three phones, which we’re expecting to be the Galaxy S26, S26 Edge, and S26 Ultra — rumor has it that next year’s Plus model will be replaced by the follow-up to this year’s extra-thin S25 Edge. While both the S26 and S26 Ultra feature slight design changes to include a small camera island around the main lenses, the middle phone is far stranger, with a camera bump that goes all the way across the phone.\nIt’s a weird design, made a little less weird for the fact that we’ve seen something like it before: in images of the upcoming iPhone 17 range (including some shared by Dickson). We’ll find out for sure if that design is real at Apple’s iPhone launch next Tuesday, but will probably have to wait until January to see the S26 line.
