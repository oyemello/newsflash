In the six years since, Apple Arcade has grown its game offerings, and while it maintains its credo of family-friendly content, its library no longer garners the same critical praise. \nAlongside Netflix's mobile games subscription service, it seems that Apple Arcade has shifted its focus toward titles that offer endless engagement with little depth.

      "raw": "Amazon’s satellite internet service, Project Kuiper, will partner with JetBlue to provide in-flight Wi-Fi starting in 2027. It’s Project Kuiper’s first deal with an airline as it aims to keep up with the SpaceX-owned Starlink, which has already snagged satellite internet agreements with United Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Air France, and several others.\nAmazon has been working on its Starlink competitor since 2019, but the service has only just started to get off the ground. In April, Amazon successfully launched its first round of 27 low-earth orbit satellites into space. The Project Kuiper constellation has since grown to more than 100 satellites, making up a small fraction of the over 3,200 satellites it eventually plans to deploy. Amazon has another Project Kuiper launch set for later this month, but it still has ways to go to catch up to Starlink, which has more than 8,000 satellites in orbit.\nProject Kuiper-powered Wi-Fi will be available on “select” aircraft at launch. Amazon says its satellites will provide lower latency and “more reliable service” for passengers, as they orbit between 367 and 391 miles above Earth — far closer than the geostationary satellites that orbit around 22,369 miles above the planet. Amazon has also struck a deal with Airbus to build Project Kuiper’s satellite internet service into its aircraft.",

It’s also capable of cleaning the nylon mop roller with hot water, as well as drying it.\nThe Deebot X11 Omnicyclone robovac costs $1,499 and is available for purchase on Ecovacs’ website and Amazon in the US and Canada.",

That includes either a more natural gradient transitioning from one fan of light to the next or stark multicolored blades that look far different than traditional Christmas lights.\nGovee’s new strip supports Matter, Alexa, and Google Assistant, and it comes with an IP68 water- and dust-resistance rating so it can stay permanently mounted outside your house. The strips start shipping on September 22nd in the US. Pricing wasn’t shared before publication, but you can bet they’ll be expensive.

But today, I want to zoom in on the battle that’s brewing about the future of OpenAI itself. \nDespite being one of the most valuable companies in the world, OpenAI is still technically a nonprofit. That structure was designed back in 2015 to keep investors from steering artificial intelligence onto paths that could harm humanity. It’s also what set the stage for the dramatic board coup in 2023 that briefly ousted Sam Altman as CEO. And now, OpenAI is trying to shake its nonprofit structure so it can raise even more money and, eventually, go public.\n\n\nThere’s a lot at stake here, and not just for OpenAI. To unpack why it matters, I’m joined today by Catherine Bracy, CEO of TechEquity, and Orson Aguilar, CEO of LatinoProsperity. They help run EyesOnOpenAI, a coalition of advocacy groups that’s challenging OpenAI’s attempted restructuring.\nAs you’ll hear, Catherine and Orson argue that OpenAI has enjoyed the advantages of being a nonprofit while drifting away from its mission. It’s a complicated and fascinating story that cuts to the heart of how the most important AI company in the world is structured and the impacts of that structure.\nHere, I should note that OpenAI declined to comment on this episode specifically. Instead, I was referred to a May blog post from Sam Altman, in which he wrote that the company’s proposed restructuring will still create the “largest and most effective nonprofit in history.”\nIf you’d like to read more on what we talked about in this episode, check out the links below:\nOpenAI abandons plans to become a for-profit company | The Verge\nWhy California’s AG must continue the investigation into OpenAI | CalMatters\nAn open letter to OpenAI | EyesOnOpenAI\nOpenAI eyes $50B valuation in potential employee share sale | Reuters\nOpenAI thinks its critics are funded by billionaires | San Francisco Standard\nQuestions or comments about this episode?

      "raw": "Real men use electric chainsaws in temperatures down to -25C (-13F). | Image: Bluetti\t\n\nBluetti’s at IFA 2025 with the world’s first portable power station built around a sodium-ion battery, and a second, slim unit designed to mount next to the fridge to keep it running during a blackout.\nThe Pioneer Na (get it? Na = sodium) is covered in AC and USB jacks and delivers up to 1,500W of continuous power, which is enough for the majority of household or camping devices. It also accepts up to 500W of solar input. But the star of this show is its 900Wh sodium-ion battery — a “world’s first,” according to Bluetti.\nTake that claim with a… pinch of salt, however, because Bluetti announced a larger and more capable sodium-ion power station on wheels back in 2021. It’s unclear, however, if that unit ever went on sale. The Pioneer Na also arrives a few months after Elecom launched the world’s first sodium-ion power bank. \nOn the plus side, that sodium-ion (or Na-ion) chemistry allows the power station to be used in extreme cold — albeit with slightly diminished performance, Bluetti warns. But you’ll still be able to charge it in temperatures down to -15 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit), and power your devices as temps plummet to -25C (-13F). By comparison, the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries found in newer power stations shouldn’t be charged below 0C (32F) and have an operating limit of -20C (-4F). \nAnd like LFP, Na-ion batteries are not prone to thermal runaway and are good for over 4,000 cycles — that’s over 10 years if the Pioneer Na is cycled every day, and even then it’ll still be at 70 percent of its original capacity. Sodium is plentiful and easy to find and thus avoids the use of rare earth metals like cobalt or the lithium used in LFP batteries. \nBut here’s the catch: Manufacturing of Na-ion cells relies upon an immature supply chain, and those cells can’t match the energy density of their LFP counterparts. As a result, Na-ion batteries tend to be bigger, heavier, and more expensive than LFP batteries of the same capacity. \nThe Pioneer Na weighs 16kg (35.3lbs) and measures 340 × 247 × 317mm. That makes it much heavier and larger than Bluetti’s 11.5kg (25lb) Elite 100 V2, which measures 320 × 215 x 250mm and features a slightly larger 1kWh LFP battery, more powerful 1,800W of output, and twice the solar input. So really, you’re only buying this for use in extremely cold conditions or if you want to avoid rare earth minerals.\nThe Pioneer Na will go on sale globally starting October 15th for an undisclosed price.\nMeanwhile, Bluetti’s FridgePower Portable Power Station is just 2.95 inches thick yet has enough battery capacity (2kWh) and output (1,800W) to keep an average fridge-freezer combo running — checks chart — for nearly a full day in the event of a blackout. If you need more time or want to power additional appliances, then you can expand storage capacity with up to three expansion packs for a total of 8k Wh. It’s unclear what battery chemistry they’re using, but it’s not sodium-ion.\nFridgePower is a direct competitor to BioLite’s own behind-the-fridge battery backup solution that has yet to hit retail even though it was announced in September 2024. The Bluetti FridgePower goes on sale worldwide starting November 4th for an undisclosed price.",

      "raw": "The Nxtpaper 5G Junior ships with a choice of blue or orange case included.\t\n\nTCL has been making its E Ink-inspired Nxtpaper phones for years, but it’s taken the company until now to realize that parents are a likely demographic for it. That’s finally been remedied with the Nxtpaper 5G Junior, a kids phone launching in Europe with a focus on eye health and screentime, which arrives alongside the more mainstream Nxtpaper 60 Ultra.\nThe Nxtpaper 5G Junior has been announced at the IFA trade show, but it won’t go on sale in Europe until December and will cost £159 / €249 (around $250). It will also include a protective case. So far, there are no plans for a US launch.\nLike other recent Nxtpaper phones, the key selling point is a dedicated button that activates Max Ink Mode, which switches the matte display to a monochromatic mode that looks a lot like E Ink and is easier on the eyes for reading. The appeal to parents will be an extra way to manage screentime: not just a binary on / off, but an in-between option that’s better for kids’ eyes and not particularly well-suited to playing Fortnite. It extends the device’s battery life, too.\nThe phone includes a variety of parental controls powered by Google’s Family Link, along with a “Digital Detox” mode to encourage healthy phone use. TCL has also created a range of cutesy characters called the AI Genius Squad, which look like they’ve been lifted from a slightly subpar Pixar movie.\nOne immediate downside is that this is a pretty big phone. With a 6.7-inch screen and the included case, this will be a bulky, heavy device that might be a little tricky for smaller hands. It comes with 256GB of storage — enough for plenty of apps and games — and dual rear cameras.\nTCL is also launching the Nxtpaper 60 Ultra, the first phone to ship with the latest Nxtpaper 4.0 tech, with reduced glare and display flicker. It’s even bigger, with a 7.2-inch display and has a triple rear camera, including a 50-megapixel telephoto lens, plus optional stylus support. It’s launching today in Europe from €449 (around $525), as well as Asia and Latin America.",

It’s reminiscent of a similar wireless charger that Zens released last year, but Baseus’ new EnerGeek GT01 has additional functionality, including a 10,000mAh battery that can be separated from the adapter’s AC plug for use as a portable power bank and wireless charger, leaving behind a simple 27W USB-C charger still stuck in the wall.\nWireless charging is limited to Qi2 rates so your phone will only charge at 15W instead of the faster 25W that you’ll get from new Qi2.2 chargers. If you’re in a hurry to revive a dying phone, or want to charge a device that’s not Qi-compatible, the EnerGeek GT01 also has a USB-C port that outputs 45W on the device’s power bank half. The Qi2 pad and both USB-C ports can all be used simultaneously when the two halves are connected, but while wireless charging will maintain a steady 15W rate, the two USB ports will dynamically share the remaining available power.\nRounding out the novelties is a small LCD display on one side that shows the battery’s remaining charge level and an estimate of how many hours and minutes are left before it’s fully depleted based on what’s currently drawing power. \nIt’s expected to launch later this year for $89.99, which is a bit pricey for a 10,000mAh power bank — even with wireless charging capabilities (Anker has one for $60).
