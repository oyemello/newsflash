The EU joins the UN, Reporters Without Borders, the Foreign Press Association and a host of other organisations in denouncing the attack.\nPalestinians in Gaza gathered on Monday for the funeral of the five Al Jazeera staff members and a sixth reporter killed in an Israeli strike. Dozens stood amid bombed-out buildings in the courtyard of Al-Shifa hospital to pay their respects to Anas al-Sharif, a prominent Al Jazeera correspondent aged 28, and four of his colleagues, killed on Sunday.\nVideo footage appears to show the moment a Palestinian activist was killed as an Israeli settler fired toward him during a confrontation with unarmed Palestinians in the occupied West Bank last month. The video released Sunday by B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group, shows Israeli settler Yinon Levi firing a gun toward the person filming. The footage cuts but the camera keeps rolling as the person moans in pain.\n Continue reading...",

The story already seemed highly unlikely, and on Monday afternoon, Tesla tweeted about the video, saying, “This is fake – that’s not our screen. Tesla does NOT disable vehicles remotely.”\nOn Sunday, Instagram user @bighuey313 posted a video of his supposed deactivated Cybertruck, complete with a flashing red warning message on the truck’s main touchscreen. “Dog wtf my cybertruck just shut off on the freeway! 😡” he wrote in the caption. “Almost just crashed wtf @teslamotors.”\nThe owner also posted an image of what he claimed was a cease-and-desist letter from Tesla’s vice president of legal affairs, Dinna Eskin. The letter cites “unauthorized use of Tesla’s intellectual property in musical content distributed under your name.” \nThe video quickly went viral on BlueSky, where anti-Elon Musk sentiment has helped fuel nationwide protests against Tesla. But users quickly noticed a number of discrepancies, such as the fact that the letter opens “We represent Tesla” despite being signed by the company’s in-house counsel. The letter also uses Eskin’s old title, “Sr. Director and Deputy General Counsel,” despite her current title of VP. And the warning message isn’t formatted like Tesla’s typical in-vehicle alerts and notifications. An X user speculated that the flashing red title was likely just a YouTube video playing on fullscreen to simulate a legitimate error. \nDespite these issues, the video went viral on BlueSky, X, and Reddit — and likely will continue to travel far and wide, confirming many people’s prior opinions about Tesla and Elon Musk. \nUpdate August 11th: Tesla posted on X confirming the video is fake.",

      "raw": "On Monday, Anthropic released a hotly anticipated memory function for its Claude chatbot.\nIn a YouTube video, the company demonstrated a user asking what they had been chatting about with Claude before their vacation. Claude searches past chats to read and summarize them for the user, then asks if they’d like to move on and keep working on the same project.\n“Never lose track of your work again,” the company wrote. “Claude now remembers your past conversations, so you can seamlessly continue projects, reference previous discussions, and build on your ideas without starting from scratch every time.” \n\nThe feature works across web, desktop, and mobile, and it can keep different projects and workspaces separate. It started rolling out to Claude’s Max, Team, and Enterprise subscription tiers today — just go to “Settings” under “Profile” and switch the feature on under “Search and reference chats” — and the company said other plans should receive access soon.\nBut there’s an important caveat here: It’s not yet a persistent memory feature like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Claude will only retrieve and reference your past chats when you ask it to, and it’s not building a user profile, according to Anthropic spokesperson Ryan Donegan.\nAnthropic and OpenAI have been going head-to-head in the AI arms race for quite a while, racing to roll out competing features and functionalities — like voice modes, larger context windows, and new subscription tiers — as they both raise ever-increasing funding amounts. Last week, OpenAI launched GPT-5, and Anthropic is currently looking to close a round that could value it as high as $170 billion.\nMemory functions are another way leading AI companies are looking to attract and keep users on one chatbot service, increasing “stickiness” and user engagement.\nChatbots’ memory functions have been the subject of online debate in recent weeks, as ChatGPT has been both lauded and lambasted for its references to users’ past conversations, with some users controversially treating it as a therapist and others experiencing mental health struggles that some are referring to as “ChatGPT psychosis.”",

The screen also displays status messages letting you know when the filter or vacuum bag needs replacing, or if a clog is detected.\nThe Electro connects to Miele’s mobile app over Wi-Fi giving you another option for staying on top of those important status messages.

Right now, you can buy the 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 for $269.99 ($30 off), while the 46mm is $319.99 ($30 off). Even the OnePlus Watch 2 is cheaper than it’s ever been at $199.99 ($100 off).

It retains everything we loved in its predecessor, like dual-frequency GPS and long battery life, but now adds Google Gemini, a rotating crown that scrolls, and video watch faces. The company also added its 60S Health Check-In, which provides a quick snapshot of your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (with European users also getting EKGs) with a click of a button.\nThe OnePlus Watch 3 comes in two sizes: a new 43mm model introduced in July, and a 46mm version released back in April. Both are similar in terms of specs, but the 43mm model skips the 46mm’s temperature sensor that was used for reproductive cycle tracking and fall detection.

Some of these add-ons are more crucial than others, especially if you’re deciding what to buy early on. For example, a case and a screen protector can keep your console safe from scuffs, scratches, and drops, so both are what I’d consider to be essential. \nOn the other hand, a microSD Express card lets you add even more digital games to your library, although the console’s somewhat generous 256GB of internal storage means you may not need one right away. Some others don’t add enough to the gaming experience to be worth it. Those Joy-Con 2 steering wheel accessories? You can pass on those.\nThe Switch 2 and its games are expensive enough, so we’ve assembled this guide with picks that are a great value. You don’t need to spend hundreds on accessories — many of us at The Verge certainly aren’t. No matter your budget, we’ve included numerous categories, beginning with a starter kit of recommendations we think everyone should consider.\nOur seven must-have Switch 2 accessories\namFilm OneTouch two-pack of glossy screen protectors\nThis two-pack of glossy screen protectors is a great value.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $15.99 $8.99 at Amazon\n\ntomtoc slim carrying case for the Switch 2\nA slim, durable case that comes in multiple color schemes.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $47.99 $33 at Amazon\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller\nThe Switch 2 wireless controller with the most features, but it’s not cheap.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $89 at Walmart\n $89.99 at Best Buy\n $89 at Amazon\n\n8BitDo USB Adapter 2\nGrab this to be able to use your Xbox or PS5 controller on your Switch 2.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $19.99 $18.99 at Amazon (with on-page coupon)\n $19.99 at 8BitDo\n $19.99 at Best Buy\n\nSandisk microSD Express card\nOnce you’ve filled up the Switch 2’s built-in 256GB SSD, add some extra storage.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $53.99 at Amazon (128GB)\n $71.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $115.99 at Amazon (512GB)\n\nUgreen USB-C-to-ethernet adapter\nSwitch 2 Wi-Fi download speeds are painfully slow.

It’s similar in several ways to the excellent Pro controller that debuted alongside the Switch, especially in design, with its analog stick layout, and because it’s the most replete with features you won’t find on other Switch 2 gamepads. \nIts motion control support isn’t a novel feature (many third-party controllers offer that), but its Amiibo NFC support is still something that almost no alternatives offer. Another feature that makes this one worth considering despite its high price is its 3.5mm headphone jack, in case you want to plug in a set of wired headphones for private listening. Additionally, it can wake the Switch 2 from standby via Bluetooth (only a select few wireless models possess this ability), so you don’t have to get off your couch to hit the console’s power button. Lastly, this model has two additional buttons that can be mapped to mimic almost any other button. (some cheaper alternatives, including the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 and Pro 3, feature four extra buttons).\nThe Switch 2 Pro is very comfortable, and it’s the controller that I always want to use when given the choice between the options below. But it’s not perfect. For one, it’s pricey at $89.99, and you’d think for that price Nintendo might have opted for drift-resistant sticks. Alas, you owe $5 to your buddy who bet that Nintendo would doggedly opt again for potentiometer sticks that are proven to tear down over time. Its sticks haven’t caused issues so far, but it’s possible that they might not fare as well — and as long — as models below that feature more durable Hall effect or TMR joysticks. \nRead our review of the Switch 2 Pro\nNintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller\nThe Switch 2 Pro Controller features new remappable “GL” and “GR” rear buttons, the “C” button to access in-game chat features, and a headphone jack.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $89 at Walmart\n $89.99 at Best Buy\n $89.99 at Target\n\n8BitDo Pro 3\n8BitDo’s Pro 3 is a good alternative to the Switch 2 Pro controller: it’s slightly cheaper, yet better in some ways (and a bit worse in others) that might matter to you. \nStarting with the good, the company upgraded its joysticks to the even more durable TMR sensors. The two back paddles are carried over from the first iteration, though there’s a new pair of buttons (L4 and R4) near the triggers that can be customized. Also of note are new toggle switches around its backside (similar to what we saw on the DualSense Edge) that let you alter the travel distance of its two triggers. Toggling a switch makes the corresponding trigger feel more like a mouse click. \nIt’s also worth noting that this controller is significantly more customizable than the Switch 2 Pro, as well as most other controllers out there. Its face buttons are magnetically attached, and can be removed to let the Pro 3 flip between the Switch layout and the Xbox layout.\nWhile the Pro 3’s TMR sticks might make it last longer, there are some trade-offs compared to the pricier Nintendo alternative — none of which are deal-breakers if saving money is a top priority. For example, its attempts to replicate the subtle blips and buzzing of Nintendo’s impressive HD haptics in the Switch 2 Pro controller are just not good. Its attempts at replicating the smallest, nuanced vibrations of Donkey Kong walking in Bananza makes it go full boar. I’d sooner turn off the vibration entirely than deal with how jarringly intense it feels, and thankfully you can in the app.\nOther downsides are more minor, but are still worth knowing about. It lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, and it doesn’t have the C button to launch GameChat. However, you can easily assign the feature to one of the Pro 3’s buttons via the Switch 2’s OS — but not to its additional buttons (the two R buttons near the triggers, and the two rear paddles). If you’d prefer to use the controller’s built-in button combo to reassign in-game commands to any of its buttons, that’s easy to do, per the instructions in its PDF manual. \nRead our review of the 8BitDo Pro 3\n8BitDo Pro 3 controller\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 at Amazon\n\n8Bitdo USB Adapter 2\nIt’s technically not a controller, but I’m a broken record when it comes to recommending 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2 for households already with more than one console. In the case that you have an Xbox or a PS5 and would rather not buy a bespoke Switch 2 controller, just buy this $20 adapter instead, and use it to connect a wireless controller you already own.\nThis adapter goes into the Switch 2’s dock (or directly into the console, if you have a USB-A to C adapter). Connecting your controller is as easy as putting it into pairing mode, then ensuring that the “Pro Controller Wired Communication” option is turned on within the console’s settings. Click and hold the adapter’s coin-shaped button to initiate pairing, then you should be good to go. The DualSense’s rumble and motion controls work seamlessly, and you can remap buttons as you please within the console’s OS, just like you would an official Switch controller.\nBest adapter: 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2\nThe 8BitDo’s latest adapter resembles a flash drive, but once connected to your Switch’s dock, it allows you to wirelessly pair it with a variety of PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo controllers.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $19.99 $18.99 at Amazon (with on-page coupon)\n $19.99 at 8BitDo\n $19.99 at Best Buy\n\nBest Switch 2 cases\nDbrand Killswitch\nThe Killswitch is a great Switch 2 companion, whether you’re someone who primarily uses the console in handheld mode or while it’s docked. It’s a case that wraps around the Switch 2’s back, with detachable components that snugly grip onto each Joy-Con 2, adding some extra bulk that makes them more comfortable to hold. Above all else, it’s a great way to protect your console from scratches and slightly more significant damage. What’s also great is that it doesn’t limit its flexibility as a hybrid console.\nEach Killswitch ships with a USB-C dock adapter that is inserted into the Switch 2 dock. Since the case-equipped console can no longer fit in Nintendo’s dock, this adapter lets you connect it to your TV without taking off the case. It’s tougher to correctly align the Switch 2’s USB-C jack with this adapter than it is to put it in the dock, but it gets easier with practice. \nRead our review of the Dbrand Killswitch\nDbrand Killswitch – Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 at Dbrand\n\nTomtoc FancyCase Slim zip-up case\nThe best, slimmest zip-up case you should buy is made by Tomtoc. Compared to the Belkin hard zip-up case that I got my hands on before the Switch 2’s launch, the Tomtoc FancyCase slim case feels more durable; anecdotally, it holds up much better to being squeezed by hand. It even has more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2 sticks, so it’ll never press them in on accident. Like most zip-up cases, it features a screen cover that doubles as cartridge storage. This one can hold 12 cartridges.\nI’m confident that it’ll absorb more potential damage over time than other cases I’ve tried. Plus, it just looks cooler, with low-profile designs for gamers who don’t want to draw attention to their console. That said, its “Froz Edition” has ice cream-inspired looks that are a lot more expressive.\ntomtoc slim carrying case for the Switch 2\nThis hard case has a soft touch and a slim fit, and includes a flap that can hold up to 12 cartridges as it protects the console’s screen.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $47.99 $33 at Amazon\n\nBelkin fabric zip-up case\nBelkin’s $29.99 zip-up case is another competent, good-looking option that’s slim and lightweight. It’s worth considering over the Tomtoc for one reason only: its built-in pocket, which is great if you need to stow a charging cable or any other small doo-dads. Not to mention, this pocket contains another pocket for an AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, so you can track this case’s location should you lose track of it.\nBelkin makes a thicker, pricier version of this case that has a 20,000mAh 20W battery inside. It’s nearly identical until you open it. A cutout fits this (and only this) Belkin battery perfectly, and it lets you charge your Switch 2 at top speeds while it’s protected.\nBelkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 at Amazon\n $29.99 at Belkin\n\nBest Switch 2 cameras\nThe best webcam that you can get for your Switch 2 should be the cheapest one you can find that’s guaranteed to work with it. So far, Logitech has confirmed that almost all of its webcams support the Switch 2, and Elgato has updated its Facecam MK.2 to support it, as well. Elgato’s model is pricier than we recommend most people spend, but it’s a solid option if you also have a PC to use it with. It’s worth knowing that the Switch 2 displays low-fidelity video feeds during gameplay, so unless you plan to use the webcam with your PC as well, it’s not worth spending a lot for a model that promises great video quality. \nLogitech Brio 100 webcam\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $39.99 $24.99 at Amazon\n $39.99 $24.99 at Staples\n $39.99 $24.99 at Logitech\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Camera\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $54 at Walmart\n $54.99 at Best Buy\n $54.99 at Target\n\nElgato Facecam MK.2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $139.99 at Best Buy\n $139.99 $123.39 at Amazon\n $139.99 $129.99 at B&H Photo\n\nBest Switch 2 portable batteries\nThe Switch 2 is more powerful than the original Switch. However, it doesn’t require all that much more power to charge, even while you’re playing games. While new phones and tablets are breaking new ground with fast charging speeds, getting a power bank that can deliver at least 20W is totally sufficient to get the fastest-possible charging speeds with the Switch 2 in handheld mode. \nBy using a display-equipped USB-C cable with a wattage reading, I was able to see that the Switch 2 usually pulls a maximum of about 15-17W of power (sometimes less) from a USB-C battery during gameplay. When the system was asleep, the rate went down to between 8-13W, fluctuating at different points during the charging process. From a totally dead state, the console took almost 90 minutes to reach 69 percent with a 20W battery plugged into it. You’ll likely drain your USB-C battery more quickly if you’re playing as you charge.\nThankfully, your options for compatible batteries are plentiful. You’ll likely be paying for more power than you’ll need with the Switch 2, but more power (and especially more ports) are never a bad thing to have too much of.\nAnker Zolo Power Bank (10K, 30W)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $25.99 $16.09 at Amazon (with Prime)\n $25.99 at Anker\n\nUgreen Nexode power bank (20K, 45W)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $45.99 $34.99 at Amazon\n\nBaseus Picogo power bank (10K, 45W)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $39.99 $25.99 at Amazon\n\nBest microSD Express cards for Switch 2\nThe Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards of up to 2TB, even though models with that amount of storage aren’t yet available for purchase. Most brands make cards in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB configurations, and some offer 1TB cards as well. I’d suggest grabbing the cheapest microSD Express card you can find, as so far they all offer similarly fast read/write speeds. \nSandisk microSD Express card\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $53.99 at Amazon (128GB)\n $71.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $115.99 at Amazon (512GB)\n\nSamsung microSD Express Card (256GB)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 at Amazon\n $59.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $59.99 at Target (256GB)\n\nPNY microSD Express card\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $58.99 $54.96 at Amazon (256GB)\n $58.99 $55.99 at B&H Photo (256GB)\n $58.99 at PNY (256GB)\n\nGameStop microSD Express card\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $54.99 at GameStop (256GB)\n $189.99 at GameStop (1TB)",

Earlier this year, CEO Gary Cohen indicated iRobot could shut down within 12 months if something didn’t change. The clock is ticking.\nLast week, Cohen said that while customer response to the new product line has been “encouraging,” iRobot didn’t meet its goals this quarter “due to persistent market headwinds and delays in scaling production and sales of our new products.” He confirmed the company is still looking at a potential sale or other “strategic alternatives” to get out of debt.",

      "raw": "Conservative activist Robby Starbuck will serve as an advisor at Meta to address “ideological and political bias” within the company’s AI chatbot, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. The move comes as part of a settlement Meta reached with Starbuck, who filed a lawsuit claiming Meta AI wrongly stated he was involved in the January 6th Capitol riot.\nStarbuck has waged public pressure campaigns against companies that have diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, and Harley-Davidson dropping their DEI efforts as a result. According to a lawsuit filed in April, Starbuck claims he discovered Meta AI’s false output after a Harley-Davidson dealer published a screenshot from Meta’s AI chatbot linking Starbuck to the Capitol riot and QAnon. \nNow, following President Donald Trump’s executive order to make AI less “woke,” Starbuck will advise Meta on bias. “Since engaging on these important issues with Robby, Meta has made tremendous strides to improve the accuracy of Meta AI and mitigate ideological and political bias,” Meta and Starbuck said in a statement to the WSJ.\nDuring an interview with CNBC, Starbuck declined to say whether Meta paid him to resolve the lawsuit. “I’m one person, but this could cause a lot of problems across the entire industry when it comes to elections and political bias, and we wanted to be leaders in solving this problem,” Starbuck said during the interview. Earlier this year, Meta paid $25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over the suspensions of his accounts.\nOther people have attempted to file lawsuits alleging AI chatbot defamation. Conservative radio host Mark Walters filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in 2023, alleging that ChatGPT falsely stated that Walters was accused of embellishing funds from a non-profit organization. A judge granted summary judgment in favor of OpenAI and dismissed the defamation claim in May.",

      "raw": "Reddit says that it has caught AI companies scraping its data from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, so it’s going to start blocking the Internet Archive from indexing the vast majority of Reddit. The Wayback Machine will no longer be able to crawl post detail pages, comments, or profiles; instead, it will only be able to index the Reddit.com homepage, which effectively means Internet Archive will only be able to archive insights into which news headlines and posts were most popular on a given day.\n“Internet Archive provides a service to the open web, but we’ve been made aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine,” spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt tells The Verge. \nThe Internet Archive’s mission is to keep a digital archive of websites on the internet and “other cultural artifacts,” and the Wayback Machine is a tool you can use to look at pages as they appeared on certain dates, but Reddit believes not all of its content should be archived that way.“Until they’re able to defend their site and comply with platform policies (e.g., respecting user privacy, re: deleting removed content) we’re limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors,” Rathschmidt says. \nThe limits will start “ramping up” today, and Reddit says it reached out to the Internet Archive “in advance” to “inform them of the limits before they go into effect,” according to Rathschmidt. He says Reddit has also “raised concerns” about the ability of people to scrape content from the Internet Archive in the past.\nReddit has a recent history of cutting off access to scraper tools as AI companies have begun to use (and abuse) them en masse, but it’s willing to provide that data if companies pay. Last year, Reddit struck a deal with Google for both Google Search and AI training data early last year, and a few months later, it started blocking major search engines from crawling its data unless they pay. It also said its infamous API changes from 2023, which forced some third-party apps to shut down, leading to protests, were because those APIs were abused to train AI models. \nReddit also struck an AI deal with OpenAI, but it sued Anthropic in June, claiming Anthropic was still scraping from Reddit even after Anthropic said it wasn’t scraping anymore.\n“We have a longstanding relationship with Reddit and continue to have ongoing discussions about this matter,” Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, says in a statement to The Verge.\nUpdate, August 11th: Added statement from the Wayback Machine.",
