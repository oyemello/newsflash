      "raw": "New verification rules will take effect in certain regions next year, before rolling out globally.\t\n\nGoogle is increasing security measures around sideloading apps by removing anonymity for Android developers who distribute outside of the Play Store. Starting in September next year, Google will require developers in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand to verify their identities in order for their apps to be installed on certified Android devices via direct downloads or third-party app stores. This requirement will then roll out globally in “2027 and beyond.”\nUnder the new requirements, Android developers will need to provide Google with personal details like their legal name, address, email, and phone number, and may need to upload an official government ID. Identity verification is already a requirement for Google Play, so this change mostly impacts developers who solely distribute their apps outside of the Play Store.\n“By making Android safer, we’re protecting the open environment that allows developers and users to confidently create and connect,” Google said in its announcement. “Android’s new developer verification is an extra layer of security that deters bad actors and makes it harder for them to spread harm.”\nThis update aims to prevent users who install apps outside of Google Play from falling victim to malware and scams, making it harder for developers who release malicious apps to return under a new alias when they get removed. Apple also introduced similar developer requirements for the EU App Store in February to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA), which requires online platforms to verify “traders” who distribute products and services to consumers in the EU through their platform.\nAndroid developer verification is largely targeting commercial developers, with Google saying that it’s “committed to keeping Android an open platform” for student and hobbyist developers. Google is creating a separate Android developer console to facilitate this, which will place restrictions on the number of apps and installs.\nGoogle is inviting developers to sign up for early access to the new verification rules to help “provide feedback and help us shape the experience.” That could mean some of the new requirements will change before they go into effect, given the initial rollout is more than a year away.",

Marshall’s first party speaker, the new Bromley 750, is no different, but instead of filling a room with a bright-colored glow, it features a more subtle array of LEDs hidden behind its front speaker grill. It’s available for preorder now for $1,299 and will ship in late September.\nFront-firing speakers and a pair of tweeters on top work alongside a new sound character dial that can switch between a loud setting for filling larger spaces or a dynamic setting for smaller crowds. There are three animated presets for the Bromley 750’s LED stage lighting, with two of them reacting in real time to what’s being played.\nMarshall says battery life is over 40 hours, but that can be extended with optional backup batteries. There are inputs for connecting microphones and instruments, wheels, and an extending handle for easier transport (it weighs over 52 pounds). The Bluetooth speaker boasts an IP54 rating, so it should be able to shrug off the occasional spilled drink.",

While the broad strokes of the mouse’s design will be familiar to existing MX Master owners, it’s apparently been tweaked with a “more durable, slightly textured surface,” and transparent main buttons.\nThe bigger change is the addition of haptic feedback, intended to trigger when you switch computers, adjust the cursor, or make other tweaks to the mouse. Apparently it’ll all be customizable, including vibration intensity. There’ll also be a new “Action Ring” menu with shortcuts, and quiet clicks in line with the 3S, though there are no bumps to battery or DPI.\nI’ve been holding off on a new mouse because of rumors the MX Master 4 would launch soon, so I’ll be as keen as anyone else to hear more about it.

Those HDR images can be instantly reviewed on the new 3.6-inch OLED touchscreen at up to 1,400 nits of peak brightness, which Hasselblad says is 75 percent brighter than the original X2D 100C. Other notable upgrades include using LiDAR to assist with autofocus, a 10-stop in-body stabilization system, an additional customizable button, and a new joystick for controlling camera functions instead of using touchscreen commands.\nAt $7,399, it’s cheaper than its three-year-old predecessor, and still shares some similarities: it takes 100 megapixel photos, comes with 1TB of internal SSD storage, offers similar dynamic range, and the shape is largely unchanged. These don’t overshadow the improvements on the latest model, however, which my colleague Vjeran describes as “one of the greatest cameras I have ever used.”\nFor full specs and a detailed overview of what the Hasselblad X2D II 100C is like to use, check out Vjeran’s review of the camera here.",

      "raw": "Spotify’s new messaging feature can even be used by free accounts.\t\n\nSpotify is introducing a direct messaging feature that allows users to share music, podcast, and audiobook recommendations with each other without leaving the app. Messages is rolling out in “select markets” this week, according to Spotify’s press release, and will be available on mobile devices for Free and Premium users aged 16 years and older.\nThe messaging feature can be accessed by tapping the share icon when listening to a song, podcast, or audiobook in the Now Playing view, and selecting a friend to send it to. Spotify users can share content and start messages with people they share a Spotify plan with, or other users they’ve interacted with through Spotify before, such as via Jams, Blends, and Collaborative Playlists. \nThe feature aims to consolidate content recommendations that already happen over texts, social media, and third-party messaging services into a single location where Spotify users can more easily track their shared content. Any audio content shared with or by the user will be stored in the Messages inbox that’s accessed under the profile picture in the top-left corner of the app, making it easier to find again in the future. Spotify says the user-to-user messages are 1:1, support text conversations and emoji reactions, and are protected by “industry-standard encryption” — which will hopefully prevent any embarrassing data leaks.\nUsers can choose to accept or reject message requests, block other users, or opt out of Messages entirely. Users can also report any shared content and text messages, or the account that sent them, by holding down on the message to flag anything nefarious. Spotify says it will proactively scan Messages for “certain unlawful and harmful content” and review chats that get reported by users.\nIt’s unclear if artist accounts will also be able to use the feature to interact with fans. Spotify says that Messages was created to “complement” how content is shared through platforms like Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Snapchat, and TikTok, rather than replace those interactions. It’s an intriguing social feature for Spotify to add, especially since it’s available to free users, given the hefty limitations on those accounts, and could perhaps pave the way for more direct user-to-user interaction features in the future if it’s received well.",

      "raw": "With the start of the NFL season looming, it’s also a window where many TV contracts are up for renewal, and on Monday evening, YouTube TV and Fox sent out alerts indicating that their contract could come to an end as soon as August 27th, at 5PM ET. Google-owned YouTube TV says that “Fox is asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive,” while Fox claims that “Google is attempting to use its market power to pressure FOX to agree to unfavorable and one-sided terms, prioritizing their own interests over a fair agreement for its customer.”\nChannels at risk include Fox News, Fox Business, Fox Sports, and the Big Ten Network. But in areas where Fox also owns the local broadcast network, a disruption could also cost viewers access to a chunk of NFL games, which is why the contract is up for renewal now. Awful Announcing points out that the first big game on the slate is a college football matchup, Texas vs. Ohio State on Saturday, before week one of NFL games starts the following weekend. \nOther than navigating the shrinking reach and influence of traditional cable TV, another complication for a new deal could be Fox’s just-launched Fox One direct-to-consumer streaming package, which currently includes access for pay TV subscribers at no additional charge to them over their existing bill. It’s unclear how that might affect the negotiations, or outbursts from Trump and other politicians if Fox News is unavailable to YouTube TV’s subscribers, which analyst MoffettNathanson recently estimated at 9.4 million.\nYouTube TV’s announcement says that if they can’t reach a deal, then Fox One is an option for consumers, and that it will credit members $10 “…if Fox content becomes unavailable for an extended period of time.”",
