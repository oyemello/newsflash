      "raw": "iRobot, maker of the iconic Roomba robot vacuum, announced its second-quarter earnings late last week, and the numbers keep going down. Despite launching an entirely new product line, its revenue declined 23 percent to $127.6 million from the previous quarter, with the lucrative US and European markets being hit hardest.\nThe company has struggled in the face of increased competition from Chinese manufacturers and the collapse of a sale to Amazon, which left it deep in debt. Earlier this year, CEO Gary Cohen indicated iRobot could shut down within 12 months if something didn’t change. The clock is ticking.\nLast week, Cohen said that while customer response to the new product line has been “encouraging,” iRobot didn’t meet its goals this quarter “due to persistent market headwinds and delays in scaling production and sales of our new products.” He confirmed the company is still looking at a potential sale or other “strategic alternatives” to get out of debt.",

      "raw": "Conservative activist Robby Starbuck will serve as an advisor at Meta to address “ideological and political bias” within the company’s AI chatbot, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. The move comes as part of a settlement Meta reached with Starbuck, who filed a lawsuit claiming Meta AI wrongly stated he was involved in the January 6th Capitol riot.\nStarbuck has waged public pressure campaigns against companies that have diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, and Harley-Davidson dropping their DEI efforts as a result. According to a lawsuit filed in April, Starbuck claims he discovered Meta AI’s false output after a Harley-Davidson dealer published a screenshot from Meta’s AI chatbot linking Starbuck to the Capitol riot and QAnon. \nNow, following President Donald Trump’s executive order to make AI less “woke,” Starbuck will advise Meta on bias. “Since engaging on these important issues with Robby, Meta has made tremendous strides to improve the accuracy of Meta AI and mitigate ideological and political bias,” Meta and Starbuck said in a statement to the WSJ.\nDuring an interview with CNBC, Starbuck declined to say whether Meta paid him to resolve the lawsuit. “I’m one person, but this could cause a lot of problems across the entire industry when it comes to elections and political bias, and we wanted to be leaders in solving this problem,” Starbuck said during the interview. Earlier this year, Meta paid $25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over the suspensions of his accounts.\nOther people have attempted to file lawsuits alleging AI chatbot defamation. Conservative radio host Mark Walters filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in 2023, alleging that ChatGPT falsely stated that Walters was accused of embellishing funds from a non-profit organization. A judge granted summary judgment in favor of OpenAI and dismissed the defamation claim in May.",

      "raw": "Reddit says that it has caught AI companies scraping its data from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, so it’s going to start blocking the Internet Archive from indexing the vast majority of Reddit. The Wayback Machine will no longer be able to crawl post detail pages, comments, or profiles; instead, it will only be able to index the Reddit.com homepage, which effectively means Internet Archive will only be able to archive insights into which news headlines and posts were most popular on a given day.\n“Internet Archive provides a service to the open web, but we’ve been made aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine,” spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt tells The Verge. \nThe Internet Archive’s mission is to keep a digital archive of websites on the internet and “other cultural artifacts,” and the Wayback Machine is a tool you can use to look at pages as they appeared on certain dates, but Reddit believes not all of its content should be archived that way.“Until they’re able to defend their site and comply with platform policies (e.g., respecting user privacy, re: deleting removed content) we’re limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors,” Rathschmidt says. \nThe limits will start “ramping up” today, and Reddit says it reached out to the Internet Archive “in advance” to “inform them of the limits before they go into effect,” according to Rathschmidt. He says Reddit has also “raised concerns” about the ability of people to scrape content from the Internet Archive in the past.\nReddit has a recent history of cutting off access to scraper tools as AI companies have begun to use (and abuse) them en masse, but it’s willing to provide that data if companies pay. Last year, Reddit struck a deal with Google for both Google Search and AI training data early last year, and a few months later, it started blocking major search engines from crawling its data unless they pay. It also said its infamous API changes from 2023, which forced some third-party apps to shut down, leading to protests, were because those APIs were abused to train AI models. \nReddit also struck an AI deal with OpenAI, but it sued Anthropic in June, claiming Anthropic was still scraping from Reddit even after Anthropic said it wasn’t scraping anymore.\nThe Internet Archive didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",

ESPN is a little pricier at $29.99 per month and similarly comes with the company’s lineup of live channels, in addition to coverage of key WWE events. Both services launch on August 21st, right before the start of the NFL’s 2025 season.\nAlong with ESPN and Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery is also working on a standalone live sports streaming service of its own. When asked about sports streaming rights during an earnings call last week, Warner Bros.

      "raw": "Microsoft is moving GitHub even more closely into its CoreAI team, following the resignation of GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke today. After nearly four years as CEO, Dohmke is leaving GitHub to “become a startup founder again,” and pursue opportunities outside of Microsoft and GitHub.\nGitHub has operated as a separate company ever since Microsoft acquired it in 2018 for $7.5 billion, but Dohmke’s departure is part of a big shakeup to the way GitHub operates. Microsoft isn’t replacing Dohmke’s CEO position, and the rest of GitHub’s leadership team will now report more directly to Microsoft’s CoreAI team.\n“GitHub and its leadership team will continue its mission as part of Microsoft’s CoreAI organization, with more details shared soon,” says Dohmke in a memo to GitHub employees today. “I’ll be staying through the end of 2025 to help guide the transition and am leaving with a deep sense of pride in everything we’ve built as a remote-first organization spread around the world.”\nMicrosoft’s CoreAI team is a new engineering group led by former Meta executive Jay Parikh. It includes Microsoft’s platform and tools division and Dev Div teams, with a focus on building an AI platform and tools for both Microsoft and its customers. \nToday’s change means GitHub no longer has a single leader, or CEO, and responsibility for GitHub will align more closely to the CoreAI leadership team. GitHub’s reporting structure originally changed in 2021 when former CEO Nat Friedman stepped down, and Dohmke reported up to Julia Liuson, head of Microsoft’s developer division. Liuson then started reporting to Parikh earlier this year with the formation of the CoreAI team. \nJay Parikh, head of CoreAI, described his vision of an AI agent factory in an interview with Notepad earlier this year, and how he is convincing the developer division of Microsoft to adopt AI. “Just like how Bill [Gates] had this idea of Microsoft being a bunch of software developers building a bunch of software, I want our platform, for any enterprise or any organization, to be able to be the thing they turn into their own agent factory,” said Parikh.\nDohmke only just appeared on Decoder last week, discussing Copilot, vibe coding, and what’s next for AI. Dohmke was thinking a lot about the competition and GitHub’s role in the future of software development, and now he’s about to leave to potentially create some more competition for Microsoft’s AI efforts.\nCorrection, August 11th: GitHub was already part of CoreAI, but its leadership will no longer be under a single CEO.",

Like wireless chargers for the iPhone, the M30 magnetically attaches to the back of supported iPad models, but instead of transferring power through wire coils and induction, it uses the same Smart Connector pins that iPad accessories like the Magic Keyboard rely on.\nThe M30 Magnetic Smart Connector Charger is available now through Kuxiu’s website for $39.99 and is compatible with iPad models that feature, and can charge through, the Smart Connector on the back. These include the M4 iPad Pros as well as many versions of the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro, plus the M3 and M2-powered 11-inch iPad Air and 4th and 5th-gen versions of the 10.9-inch Air.\nIn addition to potentially being easier to pop on and off the iPad than plugging in a USB cable, the M30 charger also frees up the tablet’s lone USB-C port. When traveling, I frequently connect an iPad Pro to a hotel TV over USB-C to watch Netflix and Disney Plus, but that typically requires the use of a hub for connecting both an HDMI cable and power cord to the iPad’s USB-C port at the same time. The M30 removes the need for a hub, assuming you just need to connect a single accessory, like an external drive.\nThe M30 will also charge certain iPad models faster than even the new Qi2.2 wireless charging standard can. Supported iPad models using Apple’s M2 and M3 chips will charge at up to 18W, but those with an M4 chip can charge at 35W speeds. For comparison, the iPhone 16 lineup can be wirelessly charged at up to 25W speeds using the new version of the MagSafe charging puck that Apple introduced in September.",

      "raw": "So, you’re thinking of buying a smart ring. Well, some good news. Picking the best of the lot is incredibly easy right now. The “bad” news is that, as far as trustworthiness and reliability, your choices are somewhat limited, as this is still a niche and emerging gadget category.\nSmart rings are in the middle of a resurgence. That means a lot of experimental ideas and newcomer tech brands you’ve probably never heard of. Enough competitors have cropped up that I spent the better part of last summer rocking six rings like a high-tech mafia don. While these aren’t necessarily bad products (some are pretty good), many aren’t as polished as what you’d see in more mature categories like smartwatches, headphones, and smartphones. \nSpeaking of which, there are a few things to know about the category. Currently, these devices are primarily health trackers. Their benefit is that they’re more discreet and better suited to sleep tracking than a smartwatch. However, the vast majority don’t include smart alarms or push notifications. This makes them best suited for casual athletes or more wellness-minded people. In most cases, hardcore athletes would be better served by a smartwatch or fitness tracker, with a smart ring serving as a supplementary source of data. (But that’s quite an expensive endeavor.) Smart rings are also ill-suited for weightlifters, as they can easily scratch against equipment. \nWith that in mind, here’s the best smart ring for most people in 2025 — and a handful of runners-up worth highlighting for the more tech-adventurous.\nBest smart ring for most people\nOura Ring 4\nThe Oura Ring 4 has a new all-titanium design, improved battery life, and better accuracy thanks to a new sensor algorithm. \n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nMore sizes\nSlimmer design\nExpanded auto workout detection\nRedesigned app\nBetter battery life\n\nSubscription required to get all features\nI still wish this had a charging case\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349 at Amazon\n $349 at Best Buy\n $349 at Oura\n\nSurprising no one, it’s the Oura Ring 4. \nI can already hear some of you shouting, “But what about the subscription!” And I agree. Even Oura’s relatively affordable $5.99 monthly fee can feel more like $100 when you consider the sheer number of apps, gadgets, and services asking for a chunk of your monthly paycheck. However, Oura is still the best in terms of hardware, size range, features offered, app, dedication to research, and experience in the field. Many of the smart rings available today follow the example Oura set this past decade. \nThe upgrades from the Oura Ring Gen 3 to the Oura Ring 4 were mostly software-based, with minor hardware refinements. You can read more in my review, but the gist is a more accurate heart rate and blood oxygen algorithm, improved automatic activity detection, and an expanded range that spans size 4 to 15. The app has been redesigned to be less cluttered, and in the last few months, Oura added AI-powered meal logging and glucose tracking, the latter of which requires Oura users to purchase a Dexcom Stelo CGM ($99). It also recently launched an AI chatbot. (Of the AI chatbots in health trackers I’ve tested, this one is among the more polished implementations — though it often feels like Captain Obvious-level insights.) \nI’ve been long-term testing three iterations of the Oura Ring since 2018. Accuracy, design, and comfort have improved with each generation. The company continues to frequently and clearly communicate research and scientific developments. Third-party retail options have expanded, and I’ve seen investment pour into Oura. In an emerging category, these things matter. A lot. While I believe some of Oura’s newer competitors do some things better or have more creative ideas, Oura is the one I continually recommend for its combination of reliability, accuracy, and experience.\nRead my full Oura Ring 4 review.\nHonorable mentions\nIf subscriptions are an absolute dealbreaker, you’ll find zero protest here. In that case, here are the best alternatives to the Oura Ring. \nSamsung Galaxy Ring\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent hardware\nLong battery life\nSlim, lightweight design\nNo subscription\n\nAndroid only\nBetter if used with Samsung products\nAccuracy is a mixed bag\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 $299.99 at Amazon\n $399.99 $299.99 at Best Buy\n $399.99 $299.99 at Samsung \n\nThe $400 Samsung Galaxy Ring nails the hardware. Its charging case is more elegant than the Oura Ring’s, and I prefer the slightly concave design for comfort. It also has the second widest size range. If you’re already all-in on a Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 or Ultra, you get the added benefit of extended battery life. If you have the latest Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Z Fold 6, Samsung also has gesture controls for the ring so you can control the camera.\nThere are a lot of interesting ecosystem-centric ideas that Samsung has for its Galaxy Ring, but while there’s no subscription (yet), it’ll cost you a pretty penny to unlock the ring’s full potential. Without discounts, we’re talking about $1,800 to nearly $3,000 for the phone, watch, and ring. The Galaxy Ring is also a first-gen device with some first-gen quirks, too. Samsung is still catching up with sleep tracking accuracy, and its Galaxy AI-powered health features are rather hit or miss.\nUltrahuman Ring Air\nThe Ultrahuman Ring Air is a subscription-free alternative to the Oura Ring that offers a more fitness-focused experience.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349 at Amazon\n $349 at Best Buy\n $349 at Ultrahuman\n\nI’m also keen on the $350 Ultrahuman Ring Air. It gave the Oura Ring an honest run for its money when I tested six smart rings at once last year. It’s not quite as good with accuracy, but it’s on par with comfort and design. The app has much more of a fitness focus than wellness. Instead of a subscription, it has “PowerPlugs.” You can think of them as add-on features. Some are free, like smart alarms and cycle tracking. Others will come with an additional fee, like a planned atrial fibrillation detection PowerPlug and a cardio adaptability metric, which currently costs $24 a year.\nRingConn Gen 2 Air\nA lighter, entry-level version of RingConn’s latest smart ring. It offers roughly 10 days of battery life, AI features, and basic health and sleep tracking.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $199 at Amazon\n $199 at RingConn\n\nLastly, I’ve been testing the RingConn Gen 2 Air, a slimmer, entry-level version of its Gen 2 ring. At $200, it’s the most affordable smart ring I’ve tested but looks and feels a lot nicer than the original RingConn I tested last summer. I had issues with the RingConn’s squarish shape, but it’s much less noticeable this time around and more comfortable. It’s broadly accurate, and the app goes heavy on AI, to middling effect. It has great battery life. I’ve gotten around eight to nine days on a single charge — far better than any other smart ring I’ve tested. \nUpdate, August 11th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability.",

      "raw": "Let’s be honest, Gigabyte. Your marketing for the Aero X16 is giving Razer Blade, from the colors and font of the spec slides to the thin design of the space gray laptop itself. While we haven’t tested out this model to see how it stacks up to Razer’s gaming machine, its price is certainly a lot more attractive. At Best Buy, you can get a capable midrange model with AMD’s Ryzen AI 7 350 CPU, Nvidia’s RTX 5070 graphics chip, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $1,299.99 (normally $1,649.99).\nGigabyte Aero X16\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1649.99 $1299.99 at Best Buy\n\nWhether you’re in need of a laptop built mainly for gaming, creative work, or work tasks, there’s a lot to like with this Aero X16 configuration. It has a 16:10 aspect ratio QHD screen, which affords a bit more vertical space than your average laptop screen (letting you read more lines at once without scrolling, for example). It has a lot of other specs that I’m happy to see in a laptop that costs less than $1,500, like a 165Hz high refresh rate screen, a capable RTX 5070 GPU, plus the ability to easily add more RAM (two slots, with support for up to 64GB DDR5 5,600MHz) and storage (two PCIe 4.0 slots) after purchase.\nComparing this Gigabyte model to its closest Razer Blade 16 equivalent isn’t exactly apples to apples, of course — there’s some features you just won’t see in the Aero X16. The RTX 5070-equipped Blade 16 is $2,399.99, and likewise comes with 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD, but you’ll also get a QHD OLED panel with a 240Hz refresh rate by default, not to mention a more polished design.\nOther deals to get your Monday going\nThe Doom: The Dark Ages-inspired Xbox wireless controller that’s covered in Doom Slayer design flair is $54 at Walmart, down from its original $79.99 price. If you’ve always wanted a controller with a blood splatter painted on, and its ABXY labels replaced with in-game glyphs, this is the gamepad for you. Looking past the unique design, it’s a standard Xbox wireless controller, with replaceable AA batteries, reliable connectivity, and Bluetooth support for seamless pairing with PCs, phones, tablets, and more.\nA bunch of PS5 disc games are discounted at Best Buy for seemingly no apparent reason — not that a reason is ever required for good discounts. Konami and Bloober Team’s brilliant remake of Silent Hill 2 is $29.99, Death Stranding Director’s Cut is just $19.99, and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is $29.99, among several other deals. Many of these prices match the lowest that we’ve seen to date.\nMost high-speed power banks also include a bunch of capacity, so you can recharge large gadgets multiple times. However, if your need for speed trumps capacity (say, if you need something on the smaller side for your bag), head over to Woot where you can grab Anker’s screen-equipped Prime 12,000mAh battery for $59.99 (originally $99.99). It has a maximum speed of 65W if you’re charging with a single port. It supports two-way charging, simultaneously accepting up to a 65W charge from the other USB-C port. If you’d rather shop at Best Buy, that retailer has this model for a few bucks more, costing $62.99. This battery can recharge most phones multiple times, but only has enough to keep your laptop topped up (or charged halfway or so from a dead battery).",

      "raw": "The Trump administration has ordered Nvidia and AMD to pay the federal government a 15 percent cut of their AI chip sales revenue to China, according to reports from The New York Times and The Financial Times. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly reached an agreement with President Donald Trump just days before the Commerce Department granted the companies licenses to sell AI chips.\nPresident Trump confirmed reports of the deal during a press conference on Monday, saying he originally asked for a 20 percent cut but lowered it to 15 percent after negotiations with Huang. “I said, ‘Listen, I want 20 percent if I’m going to approve this for you, for the country,’” Trump said. “And he [Huang] said, ‘Would you make it 15?’ So we negotiate a little deal.”\nThe approved shipments include Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308, both of which are stripped-down versions of their AI-focused GPUs, designed to comply with US export rules to China. After the Trump administration put restrictions on AI chip sales to China in April, both companies confirmed last month that they would soon resume shipments once they received licenses. Nvidia’s H20 chip came under fire last week after the Chinese government raised concerns that its chips could have a government “backdoor.”\nTrump said the H20 chip is an “old chip that China already has,” adding that he would consider letting Nvidia sell its Blackwell chip to China if the company lowers its performance by “30 to 50 percent.“\nThe Trump administration’s deal with Nvidia and AMD could net the US government $2 billion per year, according to the New York Times. The Times calls the agreement “highly unusual,” a running theme for an administration that’s taken in money from meme coin dinners, lawsuits against universities, shakedowns of TV networks, and a flood of unpredictable tariffs. Last week, Trump threatened to impose a 100 percent tariff on semiconductors unless companies reach a deal to bring manufacturing to the US.\nPresident Trump said earlier this year that he weighed breaking up Nvidia before Huang embarked on a campaign of flattery, which ended up also winning the removal of AI chip export limits. Trump has inserted himself into other major business dealings in the name of national security, proposing a joint venture that would give the US government 50 percent ownership of TikTok and recently demanding the resignation of Intel’s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, over his connections to China.\nUpdate, August 11th: Added confirmation from Trump.",

It's for this reason some scientists are also exploring the potential for life in so-called \"water worlds\" elsewhere in the solar system, like some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. This episode, Regina digs into two water-related hypotheses for the origin on life on Earth — and what that might mean for possible alien life.\nHave another scientific mystery you want us to cover on a future episode?

      "raw": "In today’s newsletter: A Guardian investigation uncovers chilling evidence that civilians in Gaza appear to have been targeted by coordinated ​gunfire during food distributions\nGood morning. In May 2025, Israel dismantled the United Nations-led humanitarian aid distribution system in Gaza. In its place came a distribution scheme run by the secretive Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) that came under immediate scrutiny for its “militarised model” and close ties to Israeli authorities, which rights groups warned “undermines the core humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence”.\nIn the months since, humanitarians’ worst fears about the aid sites have been realised. International observers have expressed concern as daily reports emerged of civilians being shot, shelled or crushed while attempting to access aid. Almost 1,400 Palestinians have reportedly been killed while seeking food, primarily near GHF distribution sites.\nIsrael-Gaza war | Benjamin Netanyahu has defended his plan to take control of Gaza City, even as senior UN officials warned the move risked unleashing “another calamity” on the territory. On Sunday, Anas al-Sharif, a prominent Al Jazeera journalist, was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel admitted a deliberate attack on the journalist.\nUkraine | Europe’s leaders have raised the pressure on Donald Trump to involve Ukraine in a planned summit with Vladimir Putin, as Germany warned the White House against any deal hatched “over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians”.\nHousing | Lower-income householders, minority ethnic people and those with young children are more likely to live in homes at risk from dangerous overheating, research has found.\nUK news | Half of the people arrested during the protest in relation to Palestine Action in London on Saturday were aged 60 or above, according to police figures. A total of 532 people were arrested at the largest demonstration relating to the group – all but 10 under section 13 of the Terrorism Act for displaying supportive placards or signs.\nCrime | Foreign criminals from 15 more countries face deportation before they have a chance to appeal, in an expansion of the UK government’s “deport first, appeal later” scheme.\n Continue reading...",
