Where once the invaders might have tried small group assaults with armoured vehicles, now the tactic is to try and sneak through on foot one by one, evading frontline Ukrainian drones, and find somewhere to hide.\nUnder what little cover remains, survivors then try to gather a group of 10 or so and attack Ukrainian positions. It is costly – “in the last 24 hours we killed 11,” Afer says – but the assaults that previously might have happened once or twice a day are now relentless. To the Da Vinci commander it seems that the Russians are terrified of their own officers, which is why they follow near suicidal orders.\n Continue reading...",

The last time that the leaders of these three countries were together in public was at the height of the cold war.\n“Humanity once again faces the choice between peace or war, dialogue or confrontation,” the Chinese president told the gathered crowds. His insistence that China would “adhere to the path of peaceful development” was punctured somewhat by the country’s biggest ever military parade that marched through the square beneath his rostrum atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace, the entrance to the Forbidden City that has – on and off – been the seat of Chinese power since the 15th century.\n Continue reading...",

      "raw": "Robot vacuums are impressive devices that will clean your floors well and — thanks to bigger batteries and better robot brains — rarely get tired of doing their job. Over the last few years, they have gone from being utilitarian devices that sweep your floor to full-fledged home robots that can vacuum and mop your home and then trundle off to clean themselves to be ready for the next run. \nI’ve been testing robot vacuums for seven years and have run over 70 robot vacuums all over my house. These are my top picks if you’re looking for the best: a robot vacuum that can do it all with limited intervention from you.\nAlong with my top picks, I have options to fit specific needs, such as mopping or besting pet hair. The good news is that there are a lot of great options. Whether you have a 3,000-square-foot home and three shaggy dogs or a small, stylish apartment you share with a goldfish, there’s a robot vacuum to suit your needs. \nFeatured in this article\nBest overall: Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWith top-notch vacuuming performance, an easy-to-use app, and built-in voice control, the S8 MaxV Ultra is a superb vacuum and good mop.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $999.99 at Amazon\n $1799.99 $999.99 at Best Buy\n $1799.99 $999.99 at Kohl’s\n\nBest budget option: Tapo RV30 Max Plus\nTap’s RV30 Max Plus is a robot vacuum / mop hybrid with room-specific cleaning, carpet boost, smart navigation, and an optional auto-empty dock.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $229.99 at TP-Link (with code 70RV30MAX)\n $329.99 $249.99 at Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest robot vacuum\nBest budget robot vacuum\nBest mopping robot vacuum for hard floors\nBest robot vacuum / mop hybrid\nBest midrange robot vacuum / mop \nBest robot vacuum for pet hair\nOther robot vacuums to consider\nWhat I’m testing and what’s coming next\n\nBest robot vacuum\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent vacuuming performance\nGood sonic mopping\nExtendable side brush gets into corners better\nVery good app\n\nDock is still quite ugly\nMopping tray is hard to clean\nExpensive\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $999.99 at Amazon \n $1799.99 $999.99 at Best Buy\n $1799.99 $999.99 at Kohl’s\n\nDustbin capacity: 270ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 20mm / Mop washing: Hot water and heated air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 10,000Pa / Remote check-in: Yes / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Apple Home via Matter\nRoborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra ($1,799.99) is an exceptional vacuum cleaner and a very good mop. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 10,000Pa suction make it great on carpets; its sonic mopping is very good on hard floors, and its improved AI-powered obstacle detection means it will most likely get the job done without getting trapped or derailed.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra is the best in the category of “hands-free” robot vacs, bots that do virtually everything for you: empty their bins, refill their mop tanks, and clean and dry their mop pads. Roborock invented this category with the S7 MaxV Ultra and has been steadily improving it.\nThat’s the big selling point here; this bot is basically hands-free. Fill the S8 MaxV Ultra’s clean water tank and empty its dirty water once a week and change out the dust bag every couple of months. The robot will take care of the rest.\nFor $100 more, you can dispense with dealing with the water tanks entirely and buy the Refill & Drainage System model. This lets you plumb the charging base directly into your home’s water supply. I’ve not tested this on the Roborock, but my experience with the SwitchBot S10 with the same feature leads me to recommend this option if you can swing it.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra comes with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, bringing back the camera it last had on the S7 MaxV Ultra. It’s not quite as good as Roomba’s obstacle detection — it sometimes confused a pile of Cheerios for a charging cable and avoided them — but it’s much better than the Roborocks that rely on non-camera obstacle detection. It deftly navigates around most household clutter, allowing you to get the job done without having to tidy up.\nRoborock has caught up to Roomba on cleaning prowess, and the S8 MaxV Ultra’s dual rubber brushes and 10,000Pa of suction power tackled the pet hair on my fluffy carpet and demolished my oatmeal test. \nIt also did a better job at mopping than Roomba’s mopping bots, though not quite as well as the Narwal Freo X Ultra or Dreame X40 Ultra, though it’s a better vacuum than either. \nIts sonic mopping system — which vibrates its mop pad 4,000 times a minute — ably simulated scrubbing and wiped out my OJ and ketchup tests, though I did have to set it to deep scrub. Plus, the addition of a side mop and flexi-arm brush that extends from the bot helped with cleaning edges and corners.\nRoborock’s mobile app is easy to use and comes with a laundry list of features and customizations that give you ample control over your cleaning. The S8 MaxV Ultra also has a built-in voice assistant, which makes getting the bot to clean the mess your kid made after dinner as easy as saying, “Rocky, clean here.” \nRoborock also sells the S8 Max Ultra (no V) for $1,599.99. It has the same cleaning hardware as the MaxV but no camera, so its obstacle detection will not be as good. However, you also don’t have to worry about a camera in your house. It has a lower 8,000Pa of suction and lacks a voice assistant, too, which makes it seem overpriced since it’s currently only a couple hundred dollars less than the MaxV.\nThere are several great vacuum / mop hybrids in this guide. Of them, the S8 MaxV Ultra is the best at vacuuming and obstacle detection, and it’s a very good mop. It can also do both in one run, as it can lift its mop 20mm, which will clear all but the highest-pile rugs. If you have a lot of those, go for the Dreame X40, with its automatic mop removal. Its vacuuming and object detection are a notch below the Roborock’s, but its mopping is a notch above. The Narwal Freo X Ultra is an even better mop than the Dreame, but its obstacle detection isn’t great, and its vacuuming is merely pretty good.\nRead my Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra review.\nBest budget robot vacuum\nTapo RV30 Max Plus\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nCheap, even with the auto-empty dock \nA dual mop and dustbin means no swapping\nRoom-specific cleaning\nCarpet boost\n\nShort battery life\nSlow to recharge\nDocking can be spotty\nBasic obstacle detection\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $229.99 at TP-Link (with code 70RV30MAX)\n $329.99 $249.99 at Amazon\n\nDustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: No / Mop lift: No / Mop washing: No /  Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: No / Suction power: 5,300Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nFor around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you’re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin.\nThanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up. \nIts 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it had generally picked up all visible debris.\nMopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water to do a good surface clean.\nAnother unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as the three rotations.\n\n5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price\n\n\nThe Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can even set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots.\nIt’s also super easy to start a clean, and I really like that you can just tap on the map to send the robot to that spot. The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally had trouble repositioning itself on its dock. You can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin.\nBest mopping robot vacuum for hard floors\nNarwal Freo X Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nThe best mopping robot\nAlso good at vacuuming\nVery quiet\nBig water tanks mean less refilling\n\nMiddling laser-based obstacle avoidance\nWonky app\nHuge charging dock\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $899.99 $549.99 at Narwal (with code BTSXU)\n $899.99 $699.99 at Costco (with Accessory Pack Bundle)\n\nDustbin capacity: 1L / Self-empty dock option: No / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying /  Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,200Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Narwal Freo X Ultra is one of the best mopping robots I’ve tested — and it’s a good vacuum, too. Its spinning triangular mop pads rotate at 180RPM with 12n of downward pressure. Combined with its ability to swing slightly to get closer to baseboards, the Narwal does a very good job on hard floors. Its dual four-liter water tanks will keep you going longer than most other mopping bots as well, the majority of which feature smaller tanks.\nThe Narwal has some innovative features, including dirt sense — which analyzes the dirt level in the water and prompts it to remop — and an ability to adapt the pressure of its mop based on the type of floor, applying more pressure to tile and less to hardwood. “Freo” refers to the bot’s ability to make cleaning “decisions,” including going back to clean dirty floors.\nIts charging dock is very big, though, giving off a real Wall-E vibe. But despite the size, there’s no spot for an auto-empty dustbin; instead, Narwal’s disposable onboard bin compresses the dust, and Narwal claims you won’t need to empty it for up to 60 days. It wasn’t close to full after two weeks of testing. A bonus here is that there’s no loud noise, as is the case with most auto-empty docks.\n\nIts charging dock is very big, giving off a real Wall-E vibe\n\n\nIn fact, the Freo X Ultra is one of the quietest bots I’ve tested. Even at full power, it was so quiet that I had to check that it was working. Its anti-tangle brush and 8,200Pa suction did a good job on most carpet, but its 12mm mop lifting isn’t good for plush carpets.\nNarwal’s obstacle detection is also only okay; there’s no camera, and it routinely eats cables. Its three lasers can identify objects as small as a sock and move around them, and it did pass my fake pet poop test.\nThe app is very hard to follow, making it tricky to access all of the bot’s features. Mapping was fast, but it didn’t recognize all my rooms on the first go. It did better the second time, although splitting up rooms and naming them in the app was painful. The lack of a camera also means its navigation is spotty, and sending it to clean specific rooms wasn’t always successful. But if you’ve got a lot of hard floors to keep clean, it will do an excellent job.\nBest robot vacuum / mop hybrid\nDreame X40 Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSelf-removing mop pads \nMop extension reaches under edges\nSelf-cleaning washboard\nDirt detection tech\n\nMiddling AI obstacle detection \nSingle rubber roller brush\nApp can be flaky\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $849.99 at Dreame\n $1499.99 $899.99 at Amazon\n $1499.99 $899.99 at Walmart\n\nDustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop-lift: Yes, 20mm / Mop washing: Hot water, hot air drying /  Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Remote check-in: Yes / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts \nThe Dreame X40 is the best robot vacuum / mop hybrid because it can drop its mop pads automatically, extend them, and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it. That’s impressive.\nThe X40 also features an extending side brush arm to reach corners — like the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra — and its dual oscillating mop pads are more effective than Roborock’s thin microfiber pad. If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you.\nIts signature feature is its ability to automatically remove and reattach its mop pads, depending on whether it’s vacuuming or mopping. This solves the problem of how to vacuum and mop without getting your rugs wet. The robot will do this procedure multiple times during cleaning to ensure carpets are vacuumed and floors are mopped. Genius.\nWhile it’s a superb mopper, its vacuuming prowess is slightly behind the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra because, despite its 12,000Pa suction power, it still only has a single roller rubber brush. The Roborock’s dual rollers are simply better at getting dirt out of carpets and tackling pet hair.\n\nIf you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you\n\n\nRoborock’s app is also more stable and easier to use than Dreame’s, which often crashes and can take a while to load. While the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is my top pick overall, the Dreame X40 is a very good vacuum, and the two companies are neck and neck regarding innovative features.\nThe X40 can also clean its washboard, something the Roborock can’t. That area can get quite grungy, so it needs a cleaning every few weeks. The X40 has AI-powered smart dirt detection that uses its cameras to identify spills like milk or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it will slow down and do a more thorough cleaning. I also like Dreame’s option to vacuum first and then mop, which the Roborock doesn’t offer.\nThe X40 has AI-powered obstacle detection, although Roborock’s is just a bit better. However, both still get tripped up occasionally by pencils and other small items — something that never happens with the Roombas with this feature.\nBest midrange robot vacuum / mop \nEufy X10 Pro Omni\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood AI-powered obstacle detection\nEffective mopping\nExcellent value\nNice dock\n\nSingle rubber / bristle brush\nLower suction power \nNo heated mop washing\nSome navigation issues\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799.99 $549.99 at Amazon (with coupon)\n $799.99 $549.99 at Eufy (with code WS24T2351)\n $799.99 $699.99 at Best Buy\n\nDustbin capacity: Unknown / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying /  Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single rubber / bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home \nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni combines the Eufy Clean X9 Pro mopping robot vacuum and the Eufy X8 Pro self-empty robot vacuum. It’s the first Eufy with a multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock, and unlike many bots in this price range, it comes with AI-powered obstacle detection.\nWith 8,000Pa suction and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping, the X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”\n\n The X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them\n\n\nThe Eufy performed excellently in my mopping tests, even eradicating dried stains with its 1kg of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some mopping bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. (There’s no hot water washing.)\nAn edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges. With its square-ish shape, it got into corners better than most of the round bots. But its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.\nThe X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.\nWhile its vacuuming is good, particularly on carpet and tile surfaces, the single rubber / bristle roller brush lets it down and is a good illustration of my point that it’s not all about suction power; it’s also about the brushes and how you use them. The Eufy’s brush is supposedly anti-tangle — a cutting tool inside the robot should shred the hair — but this wasn’t effective.\nThe Eufy Clean app is very easy to use, and the lidar-powered mapping was fast and accurate, dividing my rooms correctly on the first try. There are many customization options — including room-specific cleaning, zone cleaning, and customized cleaning — but the app is clear and well laid out.\nBest robot vacuum for pet hair\nRoomba Combo 10 Max\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent vacuuming\nSuperior AI obstacle detection\nSmart scrub feature works well\nAttractive dock that doubles as a table\n\nSmall mop pad\nLimited cleaning customization\nMapping can take a long time\nNavigation can be buggy\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1399.99 $599 at Amazon\n $1399.99 $599 at Best Buy\n $1399.99 $1199.99 at iRobot\n\nDustbin capacity: 250 ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, up and over / Mop washing: Yes / Mapping: Yes, vSLAM / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: N/A / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Apple Home via the Matter protocol.\nWhile Roombas may have fallen behind the competition in terms of features and innovation, there’s one area in which they reign supreme, and that’s cleaning prowess. Their dual rubber roller brushes rotate in opposite directions to effectively dig up dirt from carpets, and they are by far the best at tackling pet hair on all surfaces. They are also one of the most self-repairable robot vacuums you can buy, with spare parts for most of the bot’s bits readily available. \nThe newest model, the Combo 10 Max, is the best Roomba for pet hair as it ties for the highest suction power of the current Roomba line, plus it can clean its own mop. It also has top-notch AI-powered obstacle detection that is able to tell the difference between pet poop and a pile of popcorn (and vacuum up one while avoiding the other). \nWhile its mopping isn’t great — the pad is tiny, and there’s no swinging to get along baseboards — it does a decent job, and its retractable mopping system is handy if you have a lot of carpets. All of this makes the Combo 10 Max a great buy for pet parents who are in a daily battle with shedding and occasional muddy paw prints. \nThe Combo is the first Roomba with a multifunction dock that can refill its mopping tank and self-wash its mopping pad, meaning less hands-on time for you. (The j9 Combo Plus has the same suction power and can refill its mopping tank but can’t wash the mop pad.) The SmartScrub feature that tells the robot to wiggle its butt to scrub your floors works surprisingly well, but it’s really only effective on small areas, making it good to run in hallways and around pet bowls for an extra clean. \n\nThe Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, actively seeking out spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out\n\n\nThe Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, and I found that meant it actively seeks out the spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out. The 10 Max can also be set to mop only, which is a new option and is handy for deep cleans. But there’s no hot water washing or hot air drying of the mop as there is on similar Dreame and Roborock models, so you’ll want to throw the pad in the washing machine every now and then. \niRobot’s app is also a bit of a pain point. While I appreciate its simplicity, I miss the deeper cleaning customization options that most other high-end robot vacuum apps offer. And it’s recently started popping up ads for Roomba products when I navigate between screens — which is one of the features I did not want to see migrate over from the competition.\nWhile its mapping is very good, it can take a really long time (Roombas use vSLAM, not lidar), and it doesn’t seem to adapt to changes in my home as easily as other robots. (It also doesn’t lose my maps as often as other robots.) I’ve also noticed that the newer Roombas (j9 and 10 Max) suffer from the occasional navigation glitches, occasionally getting confused and needing to be rebooted.\nI really like Roomba’s dock design, which, while large enough to accommodate two rather small water tanks, is the most stylish of all the multifunction docks. Plus, because you access the water tanks from the front rather than the top (as on most other models), it can be used as a table. That’s a small quality-of-life upgrade I enjoy. \nOverall, it’s a good-looking robot that vacuums really well and is smart enough to get the job done with limited intervention. If you’re not interested in mopping at all, however, save some money and get the Roomba j9 Plus. It has similar cleaning prowess, a self-empty dock, and no messing with mopping.\nOther robot vacuums to consider\nThe 360 Vis Nav ($499.99 $999.99), Dyson’s first robovac in the US in almost a decade, is a powerful beast and the best robot vacuum for carpets I’ve tested. But its navigation needs a lot of work. If you have a simple floor plan with a lot of carpets, it is worth considering, but the short battery life and lack of an auto-empty dock are major cons. Read more in this hands-on.\nThe Roomba j7 ($599.99) is a previous top pick that has great AI-powered obstacle detection, excellent navigation skills, and superior cleaning power. It can be a bit rough with furniture, but it is aggressive at getting your floors clean and is a great vacuum-only Roomba.\nThe Dreame X30 Ultra ($599.98  $899.99) is the older version of my top pick for a vacuum / mop hybrid and is a great buy if you can get it on sale. It does most everything the X40 Ultra does, just with lower suction power (8,3000Pa) and no flexi-arm.\nThe Roborock Q8 Max Plus ($379.99 $659.99) is the bigger brother to the Q5 Pro (my pick for pet hair in my budget robot vacuum guide), adding better obstacle detection (still no camera) and better mopping. However, it has a smaller bin to make way for a much bigger water reservoir for mopping (350ml). If you like the idea of the Q5 Pro but want better mopping, this is a good option.\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 ($399.99 $699.99) was my previous runner-up pick for a midrange option that self-empties its bin, vacuums, and mops. It mops very well, but you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin.\nWhat I’m testing and what’s coming next\nRoborock’s Saros 10 ($1,299.99 $1,599.99) and 10R ($1,599.99) are upgrades to the S8 MaxV Ultra. Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed — a new option for Roborock — and feature an AdaptLift chassis to climb high room transitions. The 10R features 19,000Pa suction power, StarSight 2.0 navigation, and oscillating mops. The Saros 10 has 22,000Pa of suction power, lidar navigation, and the vibrating flat mopping pad of the S8 MaxV.\nRoborock also recently released the Saros Z70 ($2,599), which is the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up objects like socks and tissues. The arm itself isn’t particularly reliable, but the Z70 still functions as an excellent robot vacuum with 22,000Pa suction power, support for Roborock’s StarSight navigation system, and an AdaptLift chassis. Read our review.\nIn March, iRobot announced a new Roomba lineup that starts at $299 and goes up to $999. All of the robovacs come with lidar navigation and mapping, 7,000Pa suction power, and four suction levels. The pricier 405 and 505 models are the first Roombas to feature dual spinning mopping pads, while the 505 also offers heated mop drying, which is something even the higher-end Combo 10 Max lacks.\nIn April, iRobot also introduced the Roomba Max 705 ($599 $899.99), which comes with an auto-empty dock. The Matter-compatible robovac brings back iRobot’s dual rubber roller brushes, which, based on our previous testing, do an excellent job of picking up pet hair; the 705 also features AI-powered obstacle detection, lidar navigation, and 13,000Pa of suction — the most of any Roomba to date.\n iRobot recently released the Roomba Max 705 Combo ($1,299.99), an upgraded version of the Roomba Max 705. The step-up model comes with a new self-deploying mop cover to protect carpets from getting wet, along with an extendable mop that cleans corners and wall edges for a more thorough clean.\nThe new Eufy Robot Vacuum Omni E28 ($799.99 with code WS24T2352111 $999.99) is a self-emptying, self-refilling, and self-washing robot vacuum / mop hybrid. The vac comes with a deep cleaner integrated into the charging dock, which you can use to spray clean water on stains before sucking everything into a separate wastewater tank. It’s also powerful, boasting up to 20,000Pa of suction power, and offers AI-powered obstacle detection and Matter support.\nThe Dreame X50 Ultra ($1,259.99 $1,699.99) adds a “motorized swing arm” that acts like a leg, allowing the robovac to climb a transition up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it’s a lot like the X40 Ultra, only with higher suction power.\nThe Ecovacs Deebot X8 Pro Omni ($899.99 $1,399.99) is the first Deebot with a roller mop. It features an extendable mop that can clean itself, boasts 18,000Pa of suction power, and comes with a redesigned auto-empty fill dock.\nThe Switchbot K10 Plus Pro Combo ($379.99 with on-page coupon 399.99) is an upgrade to the compact K10 Plus, a previous pick for the best robot vacuum for small spaces. It has better obstacle detection and a bump up to 3,000Pa of suction power. Plus, its auto-empty dock incorporates a manual stick vacuum.\nThe Switchbot S20 robot vacuum / mop hybrid ($640 with code SLOD20 $799.99), which looks like the Switchbot S20 Pro announced at CES, launched in early August. It features an extendable roller mop and side brush, as well as 15,000Pa of suction power, which is more than twice that of our previous pick for the best mopping vacuum (the last-gen S10).\nSharkNinja’s PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum / mop ($699.99 $999.99) can lift itself over rugs by up to 20mm. Uniquely, its automatic empty /wash / dry cleaning station doesn’t require bags.\nRoborock’s Qrevo Curv ($1,099.99 $1,599.99) can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The svelte-looking bot gets its name from a curved FlexiArm Arc side brush, which helps prevent hair from tangling as much.\nNarwal’s Freo Z Ultra ($949.99 with on-page coupon $1,499.99) is an upgrade to my current pick for the best mopping bot. It features dual cameras and dual AI chips for seeing and identifying objects, which should help with obstacle detection and vacuuming methods.\nThe Eufy S1 Pro ($949.99 with on-page coupon $1,499.99) has a long roller mop that self-cleans as it mops and features a square-ish design that allows it to get into corners more easily. A single rubber roller brush, 8,000Pa of suction, and 3D-powered obstacle detection tackle the vacuuming.\nThe Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum that doesn’t need a cloud connection and uses cameras to navigate. It’s also the first robovac mop I’ve seen that can suck up wet spills as well as dry ones. Here’s some video of it in action.\nPhotos by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, September 5th: Adjusted pricing / availability. Sheena Vasani also contributed to this post.",

The new episodes will also be available “same day-and-date in the US on PBS stations and PBS KIDS digital platforms.”\nLast year, Warner Bros.

      "raw": "In what’s potentially the first major payout to creatives whose work was used to train AI systems, Anthropic has reached an agreement to pay “at least” a staggering $1.5 billion, plus interest, to authors to settle its class-action lawsuit. The amount breaks down to smaller payouts expected to be approximately $3,000 per book or work. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said it’s “believed to be the largest publicly reported recovery in the history of US copyright litigation.”\n“This result is nothing short of remarkable,” the legal filing states.\nThe settlement is subject to court approval, and a hearing will take place on September 8th. According to a press release, the final amount could be higher, in that approximately 500,000 works will likely be paid out, but if the total is higher than that, Anthropic will pay an additional $3,000 per work, and it all depends on the number of claims submitted. As part of the settlement, Anthropic must also destroy the original files it downloaded and any copies.\n“The settlement only releases claims based on past acts – it does not give Anthropic a license or permission for future AI training and it does not release any claims that arise after August 25, 2025,” the release stated.\nThe landmark decision is part of a year-long saga. In August 2024, three authors — Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson — alleged that Anthropic had “built a multibillion-dollar business by stealing hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books.” Over the summer, a federal judge handed Anthropic a small win, ruling that the company was within its legal rights to train its AI models on legally purchased books. But the judge also said that Anthropic would need to face a separate trial for its alleged use of pirated books. In July, a California federal judge ruled that the authors could bring a class action lawsuit representing all US writers whose work allegedly came from libraries of pirated books downloaded by Anthropic. And late last month, Anthropic said it had settled the class action lawsuit — but we didn’t know the terms until now.\n“In June, the District Court issued a landmark ruling on AI development and copyright law, finding that Anthropic’s approach to training AI models constitutes fair use,” Aparna Sridhar, Anthropic’s deputy general counsel, told The Verge in a statement. “Today’s settlement, if approved, will resolve the plaintiffs’ remaining legacy claims. We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems.” \nThe settlement is especially noteworthy during a time of mounting lawsuits against AI companies over copyright infringement from media outlets, platforms, creatives, and companies — and, at the same time, an increasing number of partnerships with those same AI companies from companies and media outlets willing to provide data to train AI systems in order to get a piece of the pie. \nIt’s not the only legal action Anthropic has faced in recent years. This summer, Reddit filed suit against Anthropic, claiming that the AI company’s bots had accessed Reddit more than 100,000 times since July 2024, after Anthropic had said it blocked them from doing so. And in 2023, Universal Music sued Anthropic over “systematic and widespread infringement of their copyrighted song lyrics.”\nFor this case, authors and rightsholders may visit AnthropicCopyrightSettlement.com, the release stated, a website that “which gives potential class members an option to provide contact information to Class Counsel.” \n“In the coming weeks, and if the court preliminarily approves the settlement, the website will provide to find a full and easily searchable listing of all works covered by the settlement and information for class members about their options and rights regarding the settlement,” the release said. \nView Link",

      "raw": "Showrunner — the startup that wants to “revolutionize” the entertainment industry by charging people to prompt up AI-generated videos featuring copyrighted IP — is working on a new project to restore an Orson Welles classic.\nOn Friday, Showrunner announced that it has designed a new generative AI model that is meant to help recreate lost footage from The Magnificent Ambersons, Welles’ 1942 adaptation of Booth Tarkington’s 1918 novel about a family whose vast fortune is being decimated by tech-driven industrialization. Though Welles initially crafted a version of the film whose runtime clocked in at 131 minutes, RKO — one of the project’s production companies — cut it down to 88 minutes without the director’s input after he lost control of the editing process. \nThe studio’s cut went on to be nominated for four Oscars and is broadly considered to be one of Welles’ best works. Welles, whom RKO accused of being difficult to work with, disowned the studio’s version of the film. He reportedly later said that “they destroyed Ambersons and it destroyed me.”\nBut Showrunner believes that, by using generative AI, it can bring back the lost footage and give people a chance to see The Magnificent Ambersons as Welles originally intended. In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter about the new project, Showrunner co-founder Edward Saatchi admitted that while generative AI as it currently exists “can’t sustain a story beyond one short episode,” he is confident that “the technology is getting closer to prompting entire films with AI.”\nWhile Welles wrote detailed notes about how he wanted The Magnificent Amersons to be cut, RKO did not follow them and the studio ultimately destroyed the negatives correlating to the film’s lost footage for storage reasons. Showrunner intends to work around those hurdles with a mix of AI-generated approximations of what Welles might have shot and sequences featuring live actors whose faces are manipulated with gen AI to look like members of the original film’s cast. According to IndieWire, Showrunner’s FILM-1 model will be used to generate keyframes for the missing footage, and set photos will be used to create the “spatial setting.”\n To help realize the project, Showrunner has brought on Tom Clive, an AI VFX artist who specializes in face-swapping and previously worked on Alien: Romulus and Here while at Metaphysic Showrunner is also working with filmmaker Brian Rose, who previously attempted his own Ambersons restoration with hand drawn animation based on the 1942 film’s shooting script and archival photographs from the original production.\nSpeaking to NPR in 2023, Rose said that populating his recreated scenes with characters was one of the endeavor’s more challenging aspects. Rose also noted that, because Warner Bros. Discovery holds the intellectual property rights to Welles’ The Magnificent Amberson‘s, there was some uncertainty about whether he could legally release the project, and “the thought was to beg forgiveness later.”\nShowrunner is no stranger to going the “just do it and worry about the consequences later” route. The startup previously made headlines for releasing unauthorized episodes of South Park that were created with its in-house generative AI models. The company seems to be trying to get ahead of any legal trouble by choosing not to monetize its Ambersons project. \nSaatchi told THR that the goal here isn’t to make money off of the lost minutes of footage, but rather to “see them exist in the world after 80 years of people asking ‘might this have been the best film ever made in its original form.'” He also said that Showrunner will gladly give its creation to the IP holders if they “see a marketplace for it and a path for it outside of an academic context.”\nThis is exactly the sort of thing you’d expect to hear from an AI-focused founder on a mission to legitimize their business and secure deals with bigger players in the entertainment game.",

      "raw": "A smart lock is an easy solution to some common problems. Locked yourself out? Need to let a friend in to water the plants? Your latchkey kid lost their key? Hands are full, and it’s raining cats and dogs? A smart lock solves all of these problems and more.\nOne of the best smart home upgrades you can make, a smart lock gives you remote control over access to your house from anywhere, plus easy, key-free ways to unlock and lock your door. Smart locks also remember everything that happened, so they can tell you when your door was unlocked, and sometimes who did it.\nFor most people, control and convenience are big enough selling points. However, smart locks also work nicely with other smart home devices, including video doorbells and smart lighting. My favorite way to integrate locks in my home is with an evening smart home routine, which locks the doors, dims the lights, and sets my thermostat to sleep mode. We have four exterior doors, so it saves me from walking around the house at night checking everything is secure.\nHaving a connected lock on your door is as secure as a standard lock, and sometimes more. Most smart locks have the same security ratings as their non-smart counterparts (see FAQ for more details), and it’s harder to physically pick a lock without a keyway. Plus, any smart lock is more secure than leaving a spare key under a flowerpot.\nI’ve been testing smart door locks for six years and have installed more than 30 for this guide alone. Here are my top picks for your front door. Whether you want the best of the best, don’t want to replace your existing lock, are on a budget, or want a smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock, there are great options for every need.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest smart lock\nBest budget smart(ish) lock\nBest retrofit smart lock\nBest smart lock for renters\nBest fingerprint smart lock\nBest smart lock that works with Apple Home Key\nBest smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock\nBest smart lever lock\nBest smart lock that’s also a video doorbell\nBest facial recognition smart lock\nOther smart locks to consider\nOther smart locks I tested\nWhat’s coming next\nSmart lock FAQs\n\nBest smart lock\nKwikset Halo Select\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent auto-unlock function\nChoice of Wi-Fi or Matter-over-Thread\nGreat design\nDiscreet door sensor\nCan be rekeyed\n\n\nHave to choose between Thread and Kwikset’s auto-unlock\nNo Home Key or biometric access\nTouchscreen shows fingerprints\nProminent Kwikset branding\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $279 $259 at Amazon\n $279 $259 at Home Depot\n $279 $259 at Lowes\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi, Thread / Access options: Key, keycode, app, voice / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: Six to 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI Grade AAA / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Matter (including Apple Home, Samsung SmartThings)\nThe Kwikset Halo Select ($279.99) is a good-looking, reliable smart lock with top-notch security ratings, broad smart home compatibility, and the best auto-unlock function I’ve tested to date.\nI strongly believe a smart lock should look good on your door, and the Halo Select does exactly that, plus it can blend in with both traditional and contemporary door sets. (But I could do without the prominent Kwikset branding.)\nOf the four entry methods — a keyway (which is re-keyable), a touchscreen keypad, app/smart home control, and auto-unlock by location — I liked the last one the best. It worked so well that I didn’t mind that it lacks a fingerprint reader or Apple Home Key.\nMy experience with automatic unlocking on other locks (which uses a combination of Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi to determine your location) has been generally frustrating, but on the Halo Select, it’s been flawless. It unlocks just as I approach my porch, making coming home and opening the door a virtually hands-free experience.\nThe Select can also auto-lock based on your location, not just after a set amount of time as most locks offer. I also like the Halo Select’s LED lock indicator on the touchscreen, which tells you at a glance if the door is locked or unlocked.\nThe Halo Select has built-in Wi-Fi and a Thread radio, but you have to pick one. \nIf you set it up with Wi-Fi, you can use the Kwikset app and connect to Amazon Alexa and Google via the cloud. With Matter, you can connect to those platforms locally and also to Apple Home and others, but you won’t be able to use the Kwikset app after setup. so you lose the auto-unlock feature, among others.\n\nKwikset’s auto-unlock feature worked flawlessly in testing\n\n\nMatter-over-Thread does promise better battery life (I’ll need to test it for longer to determine this) and the ability to easily share the lock with other ecosystems. I set it up in Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings via Matter with no issues and could control it with all three via routines, automations, and voice commands.\nIt’s a shame to have to choose between using Matter and some of this lock’s best features, but this is a problem across Matter, not specific to Kwikset. Kwikset’s solution allows you to use its advanced features today while still having the future-proofing potential of Matter for tomorrow.\nRead my full review of the Kwikset Halo Select.\nBest budget smart(ish) lock\nWyze Lock Bolt\nThis inexpensive smart door lock has a lightning-fast fingerprint reader plus an easy-to-use, backlit keypad. It’s Bluetooth-only (unless you also buy its compatible video doorbell to act as a Wi-Fi bridge), so the battery lasts over a year. At under $80, it’s the best budget lock we tested.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nInexpensive \nGood fingerprint reader\nOffline access codes\nLong battery life\n\n\nNo Wi-Fi \nNo smart home support\nLarge rear housing\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $79.98 at Amazon\n $79.98 at Best Buy\n $79.98 at Wyze\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.0  / Access options: Fingerprint, keypad, app / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Four AA batteries  / Battery life: One year / Security Grade: ANSI/BHMA Grade 3 / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: N/A\nThe Wyze Lock Bolt is a good choice if you want something inexpensive and useful and don’t care about smart home integration — or prefer a lock without it. It’s not sleek or stylish; it’s just a big hunk of black plastic (there’s also a satin nickel version). Out of the box, it doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems, but it does have an easy-to-use backlit keypad and a lightning-fast fingerprint reader. It’ll auto-lock if you want, and it’s half the price of most smart locks in this list. \nIn addition to the fingerprint reader and keypad, the Wyze Lock Bolt can be controlled over Bluetooth, and its range is very good. I could lock the door from my bedroom at the other end of the house using the Wyze app. That’s important, as there’s no way to lock the door on a schedule (although you can enable auto-lock).\n\nThe Wyze doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems \n\n\nThe Bolt doesn’t integrate with smart home platforms, but if you don’t need to control your lock with your voice or plan to add it to any smart home routines, you won’t miss those features. It also delivers up to a year of battery life on four AAs — I tested it for three months and it only lost 15 percent.\nBut without Wi-Fi, I couldn’t check on it or control it when I was away from home, so turning on the auto-lock option is a must. If I wanted to let someone in while I was gone, I couldn’t unlock the door remotely, but I could generate an offline code in the Wyze app and share that. This uses similar technology to two-factor authentication codes and worked perfectly in my testing. \nSince I tested the lock, Wyze has introduced an integration with its Wyze Video Doorbell Pro that lets you unlock the Bolt remotely when paired with the doorbell — but it doesn’t let you lock it remotely, which is odd. Of course, if you enable auto-lock, this is less of an issue.\nBest retrofit smart lock\nNuki Smart Lock\nNuki Smart Lock\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLightning fast\nNice, compact design\nSimple to install\nSupports Wi-Fi and Matter over Thread\nNo account required\nBroad smart home compatibility\n\nSubscription required for remote access (without Matter)\nNo Apple Home Key\nProprietary charging cable\nNo door sensor included\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159 at Amazon \n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Matter-over-Thread / Access options: Key, app, voice, fingerprint and keypad (sold separately) /  Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Non-removable, rechargeable / Battery life: Up to 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe Nuki Smart Lock is the most advanced retrofit smart lock we’ve tested, and a worthy replacement for our previous pick, the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock. It features a compact design and lightning-fast locking — even quicker than manually turning the lock — and it works over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Matter over Thread, the latter of which enables out-of-home control and notifications through any Matter-compatible smart home platform.\nWhereas most smart locks feature a big, bulky design, the Nuki Smart Lock boasts a minimalist style with a premium look and feel. Installation is straightforward — simply remove the thumbturn from your existing deadbolt, replace it with a blackplate, and snap the Nuki into place. Once it’s installed, you can get up and running without signing up for an account, which is a rare feature for a smart lock.\nThe Nuki app gives you access to multiple settings and customization options. In addition to standard features like key sharing with family members and enabling auto-lock and auto-unlock, it supports schedules, an activity log, and a convenient Night Mode, which can lock the door at a set time, disable auto-unlock, and enable auto-lock.\nIf you don’t have a Matter hub and a Thread border router — like a HomePod — Nuki offers a subscription service called Nuki Premium ($5.90 per month). It adds features like remote access, lock activity notifications, and integration with rental platforms like Airbnb. Another possible upgrade is the optional keypad, which supports both PIN codes and fingerprints, making it easy for friends, family, and guests to gain access without needing to download an app. Although the fingerprint reader works well, there is no backlight, making nighttime use tricky without a porch light. The current keypad doesn’t support Apple Home Key, though Nuki is planning to release one later this year with ultra-wideband unlocking (UWB) and NFC support.\nNuki’s smart lock has a built-in battery that can last for months, and it only takes a few hours to fully recharge. While a non-removable battery raises concerns about longevity — smart locks generally use AA batteries — Nuki claims it should last 10 years. After that, the company says a replacement plan will be offered.\nRead our review of the Nuki Smart Lock.\nBest smart lock for renters\nYale Approach Lock with Wi-Fi\nThis slimline, easy-to-install, inexpensive retrofit lock is a simple solution with a year of battery life. It requires a plug-in bridge for out-of-home control and doesn’t work with Apple Home. The optional keypad adds to the cost but also to the convenience. \n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nEasy install\nOption of fingerprint keypad\nA year of battery life\n\nRequires Wi-Fi bridge\nKeypad is big and ugly\nNo support for Matter\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129.99 $96.34 at Amazon\n $229.99 at Yale (with fingerprint keypad)\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (with plug-in module) / Access options: Key, app, voice, keypad and fingerprint reader sold separately / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Four AA alkaline batteries / Battery life: 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nStarting at $130, the Yale Approach is a more affordable retrofit lock with no monthly subscription. It’s super easy to install, looks nice, and has a good list of features — auto-lock, auto-unlock, app and voice control. Add the Bluetooth keypad to get one-touch locking, key code, and fingerprint access.\nThe Approach replaces your thumb turn, so you can still use your current lock and key — making it a great option if you are renting and don’t want to annoy your landlord. It has a nice, slim profile and blends in better than the rear housing of most smart locks.\nThe lock comes in black or silver and took me less than five minutes to install. It uses four AA batteries and promises 12 months of battery life. This is because there is no built-in Wi-Fi; instead, it uses an included plug-in bridge.\nThe bridge adds out-of-home control and connection to smart home platforms, including Alexa and Google Home, but there’s no Apple Home support). This allows for voice control and adding it to smart home routines. Yale told me there’s an onboard Thread radio that will be activated to support Matter, but didn’t say when this would arrive.\nThe optional Bluetooth keypad lets you control the lock from the outside without using an app or key, and it worked promptly and reliably. There’s the option of a fingerprint version, and that was similarly a good experience — just touch and open. The keypad also allows you to lock the door when you leave by pressing the Yale logo button. \nThe keys are a bit sensitive; I frequently get double inputs when pressing. But I liked the LED indicator that notifies you with green if your code was accepted or red if there’s an issue. This made it easy to know if the input worked, as the lock is very quiet — it’s hard to hear it locking or unlocking.\nMy biggest disappointment is the look of the keypad. It’s big, wide, and black, with prominent white numbers that don’t disappear when not in use — it looks a bit like a toy keypad on your door.\nBest fingerprint smart lock\nYale Assure Lock 2 Touch\nThis fingerprint lock is fast and reliable, and the keypad is a good backup option for visitors. It works with Apple Home and can be upgraded to support Wi-Fi — which you’ll need for remote unlocking, Android phones, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home support. Auto-unlock can open the door as you approach, and you can also use a key if you just can’t let go.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFast fingerprint reader\nNice, compact design\nWorks with Apple Home\nCompatible with Wi-Fi and Z-Wave\n\nTouchscreen isn’t intuitive\nAuto-unlock can be slow / unreliable\nNo Matter support\nProminent Yale branding\nAdditional connectivity options cost extra\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $189.99 $139.99 at Amazon (Bluetooth)\n $279.99 $246.98 at Amazon (Wi-Fi)\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth (can add Wi-Fi, Z-Wave) / Access options: Key, keypad, fingerprint reader, app, voice / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: Six months to a year / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI/BHMA Grade 2 / Works with: Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe Yale Assure 2 line — previously my top pick — has something for everyone. There’s an option with or without a keyway, with a touchscreen keypad or a physical keypad, or with Apple Home Key, but my favorite model is the Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with a built-in fingerprint reader. It costs $279.99, and the built-in fingerprint reader is fast and efficient. I tested the touchscreen version, but Yale recently released a keypad version. Unless you really value the clean look of the touchscreen (which is blank when off), go with the keypad — it’s much easier to use.\nThe Yale Assure 2 is a good-looking lock that works with every smart home platform with its swappable modules. Its slimline design (both front and back), wide smart home compatibility, easy-to-use app, and good selection of unlocking options — including fingerprint unlock — make it a great option for your front door. \nThe lock supports Bluetooth out of the box and works with the Yale Access app and Apple Home app (which adds remote unlocking if you have an Apple Home hub). Along with a keycode, fingerprint reader, or key, you can also choose to use auto-unlocking. Auto-unlock is a decent alternative to fingerprint unlock, but I found I often had to wait at the door for a second or two before it worked. Still, it’s faster than fumbling through a purse for keys when your hands are full.\nSupport for other platforms and remote unlocking comes through Yale’s ingenious swappable networking modules, which cost around $80 each. There’s a Wi-Fi module to add Alexa and Google Home integration and a Z-Wave module for compatibility with (some) SmartThings hubs, Ring Alarm, and other Z-Wave hubs. Yale promised support for Matter via a Matter-over-Thread module back in 2022, but this still hasn’t materialized. They have announced a different lock that uses Thread, but it doesn’t have a fingerprint reader. I plan to test this soon.\nI tested the Wi-Fi module in the Assure 2 Touch, which worked well with Amazon Alexa and Google Home. It allowed me to add the lock to Alexa Routines, lock and unlock it with my voice, and control it away from home. The downside is that control over Wi-Fi is considerably slower than over Bluetooth and drains the battery more quickly. Yale estimates up to a year on Bluetooth only, compared to six months over Wi-Fi; I got about four months.\nRead my review of the Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch.\nBest smart lock that works with Apple Home Key\nSchlage Encode Plus\nThe Encode Plus is a high-end, reliable smart lock that works with Apple Home and has Home Key compatibility. It also has a Thread radio on board, which helps with connectivity and battery life.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSupport for Apple Home and Home Key\nWorks over Thread\nEasy-to-use keypad\nNice design options that may match your hardware\n\nExpensive\nQuite loud\nNo Matter support\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $259 at Amazon\n $329 $259 at The Home Depot\n $297.09 at Build\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi or Thread / Access options: Key, keypad, app, voice, Apple Home Key / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: Up to six months / Security Grade: ANSI Grade 1 / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Apple Home (Home Key), Amazon Alexa, Ring, and Google Home\nApple Home Key lets you use your iPhone or Apple Watch to tap to unlock your door in much the same way as you tap to pay. It uses an NFC chip in the lock, and is fast, efficient, and secure. There are no apps to open, no buttons to press, and no need to unlock your phone (although you can add that step as an extra security layer). However, it does require an Apple device; it won’t work on Android. \nHome Key took a while to gain adoption, but there are now several options (and should soon be more as Apple has made it part of Matter). The Schlage Encode Plus is still the best option — if one of the most expensive — as it has a built-in keypad and works over Thread. \nThe keypad is useful for giving access to people with whom you can’t share a Home Key (sharing is quite limited), and Thread makes for a rock-solid connection. While it won’t be updated to support Matter, the Thread radio adds better battery life and a more stable connection to Apple Home than Bluetooth. I have had numerous connectivity issues in HomeKit with Bluetooth-only locks.\nTo use Home Key, you need to have an Apple Home Hub, such as an Apple TV or HomePod. Adding the lock to the Home app automatically adds the Home Key card to your Wallet, as well as that of anyone else you have added to your Apple Home. That’s much easier than getting household members to download a whole new app for the door lock. I should know — I try regularly. \nTo allow someone not in your household to control the lock, you’ll have to give them a standard PIN, which you can do in the Apple Home app or the Schlage Encode app. If you like, you can set this lock up entirely in the Home app and never have to use the manufacturer’s app. \nRead our review of the Schlage Encode Plus.\nBest smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock\nLevel Lock Plus\nThe Level Lock Plus packs all the smarts and power into the deadbolt itself, leaving the rest of your lock looking like a normal lock. It works with Apple’s Home Key, auto-unlocks, has the option of a separate keypad, and supports Matter-over-Thread. \n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nNo branding\nSmall and unobtrusive\nSupports Home Key\nWorks over Thread\nBroad smart home compatibility through Matter\n\nExpensive\nKeypad costs extra\nAuto-unlock can be unreliable\nNot ideal for older doors\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329 $246.75 at Amazon\n $329 $246.75 at Best Buy\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth, Thread, Wi-Fi with bridge / Access options: Key, app, voice, keypad (sold separately), Apple Home Key / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: One CR2 battery / Battery life: One year / Guest codes: Yes / Security Grade: ANSI/BHMA: Grade 1 / Works with: Matter, Apple Home, Ring \nWant a smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock? Level packs all the technology inside the deadbolt — including the single CR2 battery that gets up to a year of battery life.\nThe Level Lock Plus works with Apple’s Home Key and recently started supporting Matter over Thread. You can also control it with a key, auto-unlock, touch-to-unlock, the app, and smart home integrations. If you don’t use an iPhone or have family members who don’t, you’ll want to get the Bluetooth keypad (from $79) to give you another option for access. The lock also comes with two NFC cards you can hand out.\nThe Level Lock Plus replaces the whole lock, deadbolt and all, but still looks like a traditional door lock — both in front and behind the door. There is no branding at all — this is the only smart lock I’ve tested that isn’t a tiny advertisement on my front door. There’s also the option of the Level Bolt, which only replaces the deadbolt of your existing lock. This has all the same features, bar Home Key and touch-to-unlock, and it costs significantly less. \nLevel locks work over Bluetooth out of the box and can connect to an Apple Home hub for out-of-home control. If you don’t have a HomePod or Apple TV, get the Level Lock Plus with Wi-Fi, which comes with a Connect Wi-Fi bridge. Or you can connect it to Matter for smart home and out-of-home control. You’ll need a Matter controller, which can be a HomePod or Amazon Echo smart speaker, among other options (See FAQ).\nThe Level lock also has auto-unlocking and touch-to-unlock, though with some quirks: it’s one or the other, not both. And neither works unless you leave the geofence area and come back. So if you leave the house, lock the door, get in your car, remember you forgot something, and go back to your door, it won’t unlock automatically. This is why I prefer Home Key or a keypad for unlocking.\nBased on my testing of the lock on three different doors, it is worth noting that the full replacement Level locks don’t work well with older doors. I would only consider installing this if your door lines up perfectly with the strike plate.\nLevel locks are very expensive; the Plus costs $329 ($349 for the Wi-Fi version). But it’s the way to go for an invisible smart lock that works well. \nRead my review of the Level Lock Plus.\nBest smart lever lock\nAqara Smart Lock U300\nThe first single-borehole smart lock to work with Apple Home Key, the U300 can also be unlocked with a fingerprint, making it an easy, smart addition for shed, garage, or home office doors. It works over Thread and is Matter compatible, with up to a 10-month battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229.99 $179.99 at Amazon\n\nConnectivity: Thread / Access options: Key, app, voice, keypad, NFC tag, Apple Home Key / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: 10 months / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Matter, Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe Aqara U300 is a lever-style smart lock; it replaces a knob or lever lock on a door with a single borehole rather than a door with a deadbolt lock with two holes. This type of lock is traditionally found on interior doors, pedestrian doors into garages, or side doors.\nThere are options for smart lever locks from Yale, Schlage, and Lockly, but the U300 is the only one with Home Key compatibility and a built-in fingerprint reader. It also works over Thread and supports Matter.\nI installed it on my garage door, and it works like a charm. The fingerprint reader is right where you put your thumb to open the door, so I barely notice it unlocking as I walk in. It also has a keypad, and I can use my iPhone or Apple Watch for Home Key. It’s set to auto-lock by default, but you can enable passage mode directly on the lock if you don’t want it to stay locked all the time.\nIt paired to Matter easily — I set it up in Apple Home and could add a code and Home Key all without even opening the Aqara app. Because it uses Thread, there’s no need for an Aqara hub. Thread also enables up to 10 months of battery life, according to Aqara.\nI love the idea of using smart locks on other doors in my home. I could see this working on a basement door, a home office, or any other room you like to keep people out of. However, I would like to see a way to permanently enable passage mode. Currently, you have to do it on the device, and it reverts to auto-lock after an undetermined period. This makes it somewhat useless for interior doors. It’s also very large and only comes in black or silver, so it likely wouldn’t blend in with your interior decor. A slimmer option, in more colorways, designed for inside use would be nice to see.\nThe U300 is expensive at $230, but it’s similar to other outdoor-rated options (it’s IPX4-rated). The addition of Thread — a protocol that works over a mesh network — makes it easier to extend connectivity further to places like a shed or garage.\nBest smart lock that’s also a video doorbell\nEufy FamiLock S3 Max\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nDigital peephole is useful\nPalm unlock is fast\nNo subscription fees for video\nLock supports Matter\nFacial recognition with HomeBase\n\nVery expensive\nNighttime video is not great\nNo package detection\nHomeBase required for most smart alerts\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 at Amazon\n $399.99 at Best Buy\n $399.99 at Eufy\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi or Eufy HomeBase / Access options: Key, palm unlock, keypad, app, voice / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, AAA backup / Battery life: Five months / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI Grade 1 / Works with: Matter (including Apple Home), Amazon Alexa, and Google Home\nEufy’s new FamiLock S3 Max combines a smart lock and video doorbell in one device and features a digital peephole and a wave-to-unlock function. It also has a keyway and keypad and supports Matter-over-Wi-Fi, so it can work with all the major smart home platforms.\nMy favorite of all these features is the video screen on the inside part of the lock, which shows a live feed of who is on the other side of the door. If you have a peephole or a window in your door, this might not be much use — and you can opt to get the lock without the screen for $50 less. But as a quick way to confirm who is at your door before opening it, it’s super handy.\nThe lock has another fairly unique feature: palm vein recognition technology. This lets you wave your hand over it to unlock it, and is an alternative form of biometric access to the popular fingerprint reader.\nPalm unlocking isn’t any faster or easier than using your fingerprint, though, and I found it harder to get used to. But once I got the hang of it, it worked reliably. Both my kids also picked it up quickly, and my husband, who has trouble with fingerprint locks in general, really liked it.\nThe main reason to buy this lock is for the video doorbell feature. The FamiLock’s 2K camera provides clear, crisp video during daylight hours and decent night vision, although my protruding door frame reflected the LEDs, causing the footage to blow out a bit.\nThe 180-degree diagonal field of view meant I could see top to bottom and all of one side (not the other side, though, due to the aforementioned door frame). But packages and people were clearly visible, which is most of what you want to see with a doorbell camera.\nThere’s no fee for viewing recorded footage of visitors in the Eufy app, and videos are stored locally on the device. Live view and recording pulled up promptly in the app, and the doorbell can alert you when it sees a person. For more advanced smart alerts, including facial recognition, you need to connect it to a Eufy HomeBase.\nBear in mind, Matter integration only controls the lock, as cameras aren’t supported by the standard yet, so the benefits of using Matter are fairly limited. (If you’re looking for a biometric Matter lock, Eufy’s E30 is a good fingerprint lock that uses Matter-over-Thread.)\nAdding a video doorbell to a smart lock puts a lot of strain on the battery. While you can adjust several settings to help save power, Eufy says you’ll only get about five months of battery life from the lock’s giant 15,000mAh removable battery. Handily, four AAA backup batteries are tucked into the top to keep it functioning while you’re recharging the battery (which takes a while). I’ve been testing it for over a week, and the battery indicator hasn’t budged yet.\nAt $400, this is a very expensive lock, but it works well and provides dual functionality of a doorbell and door lock.\nRead my review of the Eufy FamiLock S3 Max.\nBest facial recognition smart lock\nLockly Visage\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFacial recognition is super fast\nHome Key and a fingerprint reader\nCompact design\nComes with two rechargeable batteries\n\nKeypad is hard to see, fiddly to use\nWired door sensor is ugly\nNo support for Matter\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349 at Amazon\n $349 at The Home Depot\n $349 at Lockly\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi (2.4gHz) / Access options: Fingerprint, facial recognition, app, voice, keypad, Home Key, key / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: 10,000mAh rechargeable / Battery life: Eight months / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI Grade 1 / Works with: Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nI was very impressed with the Lockly Visage. The first facial recognition residential smart lock on the market, it also features a fingerprint reader, a keypad, a keyway, and Apple Home Key — that’s a lot of high-tech ways to unlock your door. And while it’s probably too much lock for most people, if you are a super smart home user or a major gadget nerd, you’ll love this lock.\nI was skeptical about the facial unlocking at first, but it worked really well, opening a second or two before I put my hand on the handle. The only caveat is that I had to be approaching face-on, which in most cases I was, but the couple of times I approached from a slightly odd angle, it failed to unlock. In those cases, though, I had the option of using my fingerprint or Home Key.\nThere’s also a touchscreen keypad, which is mainly useful for handing out codes to guests and visitors whose faces and fingers you don’t want to scan into your lock. The keypad is probably my least favorite part of the lock; it’s very small, which is good for the overall look, but fiddly to access. It’s also hard to see in bright light. But with all the other ways to unlock, this isn’t a deal-breaker.\nNote that the Visage doesn’t take video or still images; its infrared camera is only used for facial recognition, data for which is stored on the device. Lockly does have a video doorbell version for $429, though that doesn’t have facial recognition.\nSurprisingly, despite all the tech packed into it, the lock is compact and stylish-looking and works with the redesigned Lockly Home app, which is now more straightforward and easier to use. The lock works over Wi-Fi and supports Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa, but there’s no support for Matter.\nLockly claims eight months of battery life with its included rechargeable 10,000mAh battery. Uniquely, it comes with two batteries, so you can swap one and keep the lock online while charging the other. \nAt $350, the Lockly Visage is very expensive, but considering the tech packed into this lock, plus the two batteries, it’s not outrageous. Its solid build, broad smart home compatibility, and multiple very cool ways to control it make this a great lock.\nOther smart locks to consider\nEufy’s E30 smart lock works with both Matter-over-Thread and Wi-Fi. It has a fingerprint reader, key, and keypad, and you can use the fingerprint access through the Eufy app while connecting it to platforms like Apple Home through Matter. Unlike the Kwikset Halo Select, you can use Wi-Fi and Thread simultaneously, which is unusual. I’ve not tested it long enough to determine if you still benefit from Thread’s better battery life. It’s cheaper than the Halo, has a fingerprint reader instead of auto-unlock, and promises 8 months of battery life. It can also integrate with a Eufy doorbell to control it from a live view. It has a nice compact design, but the rear housing is huge to fit 8 AA batteries. The lock is loud in operation, and the fingerprint reader was finicky; it also has the lowest ANSI/BHMA rating.\nU-tec’s Bolt Fingerprint Matter works over Thread and can be set up directly in your smart home platform of choice — no need to use U-tec’s U Home. But if you want to use its built-in fingerprint reader, you’ll need to download the app. And if you don’t use it, then it’s kind of a waste of space, so the whole “you only need one app” feature falls flat. I also don’t love the design of the Ultraloqs, while smaller on the exterior than most smart locks, they are squat and chunky looking, resembling a combination lock rather than door hardware. It also uses eight batteries, which is an absurd amount, and is very noisy.\nIf you’re an Amazon Alexa Ring household, the Schlage Encode Wifi lock is a good option; it integrates with the Ring app, so you can lock and unlock it while viewing a live feed from your Ring doorbell. Its design will also match a Schlage door set, which is important for some people. There’s no door-sensing or auto-unlock option, but you have three reliable ways to get in: a key, a PIN, and the app. It also lasts at least six months on one set of four AAs.\nIf you want Home Key but the Schlage is too expensive or not your style, the Aqara U50 is a good, inexpensive alternative that’s less than half the price of the Schlage. It doesn’t have as good a build quality, and the keypad is a bit finicky, but it works with Apple Home and Home Key out of the box. (You‘ll need an Aqara hub for any other smart home integrations, including Matter.) It also pairs with Aqara’s G4 video doorbell to unlock the door while viewing video from the live feed. (Aqara has a doorbell that’s also a hub coming soon).\nThe Aqara Smart Lock U100 is a Matter-compatible smart lock that also works with Apple HomeKit and Home Key. A full replacement deadlock that can be unlocked by key, keypad, NFC key fob, fingerprint, voice control, through an app, or with Apple Home Key. It’s a good lock, but its smart home integrations are complicated, and there are now better options.\nThe Yale Assure SL with Matter Module is a Matter-over-Thread deadbolt smart lock. It’s simple, with a clean design and a touchscreen keypad for entry. There’s no keyway, fingerprint reader, or Apple Home Key, but in terms of simplicity, reliability, and future-proofing, it’s a good option. It’s one of the few locks you can connect directly to your smart home platform of choice without needing to download the manufacturer’s app — the Assure SL doesn’t even work with Yale’s app.\nThe SwitchBot Lock Pro is an all-around upgrade to one of my previous favorite locks, the SwitchBot lock (which is now discontinued). It’s a great solution if you have an unusual lock, as it can work on almost any door; it has higher-quality materials than the original, but now requires you to replace the rear of your lock (as most retrofit locks do). It does support Matter through a bridge, but for $200, I would still opt for Nuki.\nThe Kwikset Halo Touch is a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi fingerprint lock with a traditional keyway. As there’s no keypad, it looks more like a standard lock with the bonus of easy access. This is more limiting when it comes to sharing access to your door, but it’s a good solution for anyone who wants a simple key-free way into their home and knows they won’t need to share lots of digital keys.\nThe Tapo DL100 is a $70 smart lock with built-in Wi-Fi, a keypad, and a physical key, plus access via the Tapo mobile app and smart home integrations. It’s cheaper than my budget pick, the Wyze Bolt, and includes Wi-Fi for remote access, but you don’t get a fingerprint reader. It works with Tapo’s excellent video doorbells.\nThe SwitchBot Lock Ultra Vision is a retrofit smart lock that works with a keypad that has facial recognition built in. The keypad also has a fingerprint reader and auto-unlock. The lock can work with almost any style of door lock, connects over Bluetooth, and works with Apple Home (through Matter), Amazon Alexa, and Google Home with a SwitchBot hub.\nThe Yale Smart Lock with Matter is a $170 smart lock that works over Thread and is a full-deadbolt replacement featuring a keypad and keyway for access. It’s designed to pair with Google’s Nest video doorbells.\nOther smart locks I tested\nThe Aqara U200 is $269.99. That’s a lot for a retrofit lock — even with support for Thread, Matter, and Home Key. It has a keypad/fingerprint reader included; most retrofit locks charge extra for one. The keypad enables Apple Home Key, and this is the only retrofit lock that works with it. If that’s something you want, then this is the only option for now. Otherwise, you can get all the same functionality with the Yale Approach — plus auto-unlock — for $40 less.\nU-tec’s Ultraloq Bolt Fingerprint with Wi-Fi is the newest version of an earlier pick for best lock, the U-Bolt Pro with Wi-Fi. This version adds support for Apple Home (that’s the $199 one), but not Home Key, and a slight redesign — you no longer have to pop half the lock collar off to get to the keyhole, which is a good upgrade. It still has a fingerprint reader and auto-unlock.\nThe Lockly Vision Elite is a smart lock with a video doorbell. It’s very expensive, and it’s not a great video doorbell. Motion detection is spotty, and the camera lacks people or package detection. It works with Amazon Alexa and Google Home, but not Apple Home or Matter. Read our review.\nThe Eufy Smart Lock Touch is a very good lock in terms of function — it has an easy-to-use fingerprint reader, a nice big touchscreen keypad, the option of a key, and Wi-Fi built in. But it is just too big and techie-looking for most people’s front doors. I do like the removable 10,000mAh battery, which went eight months before needing to recharge (with a USB-A cable). But that’s also why this lock is so big.\nThe Eufy Video Smart Lock is similarly huge and very expensive; it requires a bridge to connect to Wi-Fi, and the Eufy FamiLock offers way more features for just $50 more.\nThe August Wi-Fi Smart Lock was our previous pick for the best retrofit smart lock. Its sleek, all-metal design doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb. With built-in Wi-Fi, there’s no need for an additional bridge, and it easily integrates with an optional Yale keypad for keycode access. The lock also offers an auto-unlock feature, adding convenience when your keys aren’t handy. That said, during testing, we found the auto-unlock feature wasn’t failproof, so you may need to use your phone to get inside occasionally. Read our review.\nThe Level Lock Pro is the latest smart lock from Level. At $349, it features an upgraded processor, door sensing, a passive infrared sensor for presence detection, and Matter-over-Thread support in a package that looks like a regular deadbolt. Read our impressions.\nWhat’s coming next\nThe Schlage Sense Pro is the company’s first lock to support  Matter and one of the first to use ultra-wideband technology (UWB) for hands-free unlocking. It has a keypad but no keyway and will work with the Aliro standard when it launches. This means it should support a version of Apple Home Key.\nU-tec’s Ultraloq Bolt Mission is a $400 lock that will work with UWB for hands-free unlocking; it also has a keypad and a keyway, and the company says it will support Matter.\nThe Ultraloq Bolt NFC HomeKey ($249) is U-tec’s first Apple Home Key smart lock slated for release soon. There’s no fingerprint reader, but there is a keypad and a physical key. Built-in Wi-Fi adds support for Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings.\nKwikset is launching a few new smart locks later this year. The Halo Select Plus is an NFC-enabled version of Kwikset’s Halo Select, with features like a touchscreen keypad, Matter-over-Thread support, built-in Wi-Fi, and hands-free auto-unlock. Plus, it supports a new tap-to-unlock feature that uses a compatible phone or watch as your key. The company is also set to launch the Aura Reach later this year, a Matter-over-Thread version of its mid-range Aura line.\nSmart lock FAQs\nPhotography by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, September 5th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability.
