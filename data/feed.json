      "raw": "Dyson’s 360 Vis Nav is $500 off.\t\n\nThe Dyson 360 Vis Nav is one of the most powerful robot vacuums out there. In fact, its 65 air watts of suction makes it the best option for carpets (even high pile) that we’ve tested yet. And, right now it’s half off at $499 at Amazon, Target, and directly from Dyson.\nThe robovac’s long, fluffy roller brush looks identical to what comes with Dyson’s stick vacuums, and features three surfaces designed to pick up everything from large debris to fine dust while digging deep into carpet fibers. Combined with its square body, it’s capable of reaching into corners and edges far more easily than rounder rivals. It’s 3.9 inches tall, which is small enough to let it clean under most beds and sofas.\nUnlike most robot vacuum models at this price, the 360 Vis Nav lacks bells and whistles you might be looking for, like AI-powered obstacle avoidance and a self-emptying dock. Still, this is a robovac we’d recommend for homes with simpler floor plans. Its large 500ml dustbin means you shouldn’t need to empty it often, and its built-in handle makes it easy to do when you have to. We wish its battery lasted longer than just 65 minutes per charge, but if raw suction power is your number one priority for dealing with dirty, dusty carpets, what it lacks might become easier to overlook at this price.\nRead more in our hands-on impressions.\nDyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999.99 $499.99 at Amazon\n $999.99 $499.99 at Target\n $999.99 $499.99 at Dyson\n\nA few more Verge-approved deals\nYou can buy the latest, ad-supported Kindle for $89.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which is $5 shy of its all-time low price. The entry-level e-reader is a good, budget-friendly alternative to the pricier Kindle Paperwhite, offering the same sharp and bright 300ppi display (albeit a more pocket-friendly six inches compared to seven). It also offers USB-C support, long battery life, and good overall performance, though it doesn’t feature waterproofing and a display with an adjustable color temperature. \nThe Google TV Streamer 4K is on sale for around $84.99 ($15 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart, which is also $5 off its best price to date. The set-top box is Google’s most complete streaming device yet, offering double the RAM and four times the storage of its predecessor. What really sets it apart is that it also works as a smart home hub with support for Matter and Thread, plus a built-in ethernet port for more reliable connectivity versus Wi-Fi. Read our review.\nYou can pick up the Anker 25W USB-C Wall Charger with a cable included for just $9.99 ($6 off) at Amazon and Anker (with code WSPDV272D1ST), which matches its best price to date. It’s nothing fancy, but the single-port charger delivers 25 watts, which is just enough power to quickly charge smartphones, tablets, earbuds —even the Nintendo Switch 2 — while being small enough not to block the neighboring outlet. It includes a cable, too.",

      "raw": "Four and a quarter years ago, I told you how a USB-C cable could someday power all but the beefiest gaming laptops. Now, Framework is finally fulfilling the promise of 240 watts through a USB plug. Today, it’s opening preorders for the first standards-compliant 240W USB-C PD power adapter ever sold by a computer company. \nSince Framework also has the first laptop that can support 240W USB-C PD, it’s the latest way that Framework, a startup company, is leading the PC industry. It’s the only company that’s ever delivered on the promise of modular, upgradable laptops. Today, it also appears it’ll be the first to deliver “the holy grail” of upgradable laptop graphics cards, letting you swap its existing AMD Radeon RX 7700S for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 — which also goes on preorder today.\nWhile Framework might have the first complete 240W USB-C power solution, it’s not technically the first 240W USB-C charger. We wrote about Delta’s beefy DP-240KB last November, and Ugreen put its multi-port Nexode 500W on sale this summer with a single 240W port in addition to four 100W ones (it tops out at 240W+100W+100W+60W = 500W, in case you’re curious).\nBut those three chargers are the only brand-name 240W USB-C PD power supplies I’m aware of, and I’ve only spotted a single no-name charger past that. Many companies advertising “240W” chargers are simply referring to a charger that can output 140W over one cable, plus 100W over another; true 48V@5A chargers are brand-new.\nFramework will be selling its charger for less than Delta and Ugreen. While the others cost $200 each, Framework CEO Nirav Patel tells us this one will be sold separately for $109, the same price as the 180W USB-C PD charger it originally shipped alongside the Framework Laptop 16. It only offers the one USB-C port, but both the power cable and the USB-C cable are still detachable, and the brick is quite compact — it isn’t that much bigger than the existing 180W charger, just a bit longer.\nFramework was actually the first company to ship a 180W PD charger, too, but it wasn’t quite enough to power and charge a fully kitted out Framework Laptop 16 at the same time while playing intensive games. The battery could sometimes drain while you play, and he says that won’t happen if you swap this charger in. \nDon’t expect it to give you more performance in games, though, at least not this year: The Framework Laptop 16’s new RTX 5070 graphics card is still rated for only 100W of power, like the AMD Radeon 7700S before it. That’s as much cooling and power as Framework was able to share with the GPU. \nYou will get an extra 240W capable charge port if you opt for the RTX 5070, though: the video card’s dedicated USB-C port now supports 240W of power and basic USB 2.0 functionality in addition to DisplayPort output, so you can get a single-cable docking solution that way.\nRead more about the new laptop here; below, you’ll find my old video showing just how fast it truly is to swap a discrete GPU into the Framework Laptop 16. \n\n \n @verge \nEver seen a GPU upgrade in less than 2 minutes? We tried on prototype Framework Laptop 16. #gadgets #laptops #framework #gpu #tech #techtok \n ♬ original sound – The Verge",

      "raw": "New verification rules will take effect in certain regions next year, before rolling out globally.\t\n\nGoogle is increasing security measures around sideloading apps by removing anonymity for Android developers who distribute outside of the Play Store. Starting in September next year, Google will require developers in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand to verify their identities in order for their apps to be installed on certified Android devices via direct downloads or third-party app stores. This requirement will then roll out globally in “2027 and beyond.”\nUnder the new requirements, Android developers will need to provide Google with personal details like their legal name, address, email, and phone number, and may need to upload an official government ID. Identity verification is already a requirement for Google Play, so this change mostly impacts developers who solely distribute their apps outside of the Play Store.\n“By making Android safer, we’re protecting the open environment that allows developers and users to confidently create and connect,” Google said in its announcement. “Android’s new developer verification is an extra layer of security that deters bad actors and makes it harder for them to spread harm.”\nThis update aims to prevent users who install apps outside of Google Play from falling victim to malware and scams, making it harder for developers who release malicious apps to return under a new alias when they get removed. Apple also introduced similar developer requirements for the EU App Store in February to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA), which requires online platforms to verify “traders” who distribute products and services to consumers in the EU through their platform.\nAndroid developer verification is largely targeting commercial developers, with Google saying that it’s “committed to keeping Android an open platform” for student and hobbyist developers. Google is creating a separate Android developer console to facilitate this, which will place restrictions on the number of apps and installs.\nGoogle is inviting developers to sign up for early access to the new verification rules to help “provide feedback and help us shape the experience.” That could mean some of the new requirements will change before they go into effect, given the initial rollout is more than a year away.",

It’s available for preorder now for $1,299 and will ship in late September.\nFront-firing speakers and a pair of tweeters on top work alongside a new sound character dial that can switch between a loud setting for filling larger spaces or a dynamic setting for smaller crowds. There are three animated presets for the Bromley 750’s LED stage lighting, with two of them reacting in real time to what’s being played.\nMarshall says battery life is over 40 hours, but that can be extended with optional backup batteries. There are inputs for connecting microphones and instruments, wheels, and an extending handle for easier transport (it weighs over 52 pounds). The Bluetooth speaker boasts an IP54 rating, so it should be able to shrug off the occasional spilled drink.",

While the broad strokes of the mouse’s design will be familiar to existing MX Master owners, it’s apparently been tweaked with a “more durable, slightly textured surface,” and transparent main buttons.\nThe bigger change is the addition of haptic feedback, intended to trigger when you switch computers, adjust the cursor, or make other tweaks to the mouse. Apparently it’ll all be customizable, including vibration intensity. There’ll also be a new “Action Ring” menu with shortcuts, and quiet clicks in line with the 3S, though there are no bumps to battery or DPI.\nI’ve been holding off on a new mouse because of rumors the MX Master 4 would launch soon, so I’ll be as keen as anyone else to hear more about it.
