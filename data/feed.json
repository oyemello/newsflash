      "raw": "The Supreme Court will let Mississippi’s social media age verification law take effect while the case is being argued in court. In an unsigned ruling on Thursday, the court declined to block the law after an emergency petition from trade association NetChoice. The order offers no explanation, but in a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that the law was “likely unconstitutional” — but that NetChoice hadn’t “sufficiently demonstrated” a risk of harm.\nThe law, HB 1126, requires social media platforms to verify the age of the person creating the account, while blocking users under 18 unless they have permission from a parent. It also states that social media sites must protect underage users from “harmful material” — such as sexual content and material related to self-harm  — as well as restrict data collection. \nNetChoice, which is backed by tech giants like Meta, Google, Amazon, Reddit, and Discord, argues that age verification laws for general-purpose social media violate the First Amendment. Though the trade association won an injunction to block the law last year, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated it in April, allowing the law to go into effect. As Justice Kavanaugh noted, however, numerous district courts have blocked similar laws in other states.\n“To be clear, NetChoice has, in my view, demonstrated that it is likely to succeed on the merits — namely, that enforcement of the Mississippi law would likely violate its members’ First Amendment rights.”\nDespite this setback, NetChoice is still confident that it will prevail. “Although we’re disappointed with the Court’s decision, Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment — not just in this case but across all NetChoice’s ID-for-Speech lawsuits,” Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a statement. “This is merely an unfortunate procedural delay.”\nThe decision comes as lawmakers across the US — and around the world — push age verification mandates designed to protect children from harmful content on the internet. In June, the Supreme Court upheld a Texas law that requires users to verify their ages before accessing porn sites, paving the way for similar laws to take effect — but specifically for platforms focused on adult content. Meanwhile, the UK has begun to enforce a broader online age-gating requirement that asks users to verify their age with a government ID, a face scan, or by entering credit card information on certain websites.\nJennifer Huddleston, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said in a statement that age verification laws have “significant impacts on privacy and speech rights of both adult and teen users.” Huddleston notes that today’s decision doesn’t mean the court “will automatically uphold this law as constitutional should it reach it through the full appeals process.”",

      "raw": "We live in a golden age of controllers. The gamepads on the market now are of higher quality, more versatile, and more customizable than anything from even one console generation ago. If you play games on an Xbox Series X or Series S (or a Windows PC), you have the unenviable task of choosing between several high-quality controllers from Microsoft as well as a plethora of great options from the likes of 8BitDo, PowerA, Razer, Scuf, Nacon, and Turtle Beach. Some of them have drift-resistant Hall effect or TMR-based joysticks for improved longevity, yet all of them are good for one reason or another. The days of the cheap “little sibling” controller that looked cool, but barely worked, are over.\nWe’ve spent a ton of time playing all kinds of games (first-person shooters, fighters, third-person action-adventure, racing, indie roguelikes, etc.) to test a wide swath of Xbox controllers, and it may not be a surprise that the standard, Xbox Wireless Controller is the best option for most folks. It makes for a great PC and Steam Deck controller, too. The default Xbox gamepad strikes the right balance of quality, comfort, versatility, and price, but there are several alternatives worth considering.\nFeatured in this article\nBest overall: Xbox Wireless Controller\nThe official Xbox Wireless Controller has a dedicated share button for saving clips and screenshots and sharing them online, Bluetooth support, and a USB-C port for charging up Microsoft’s play-and-charge rechargeable battery.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $64.99 $50.58 at Amazon\n $64.99 $50.58 at Walmart\n $64.99 $54.99 at GameStop\n\nBest budget option: 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox\nThe latest 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox includes Hall effect analog sticks and triggers, plus two rear buttons, customizable mapping and sensitivity, and compatibility with PC and mobile devices.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $44.99 $29.99 at 8BitDo\n $44.99 $40.99 at Amazon (at checkout)\n $44.99 at Best Buy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Xbox controller for most people\nThe best cheap Xbox controller\nThe best “pro” Xbox controller\nA formidable alternative to the Elite\nOther Xbox controllers we tested\nWhat’s coming next?\n\nThe best Xbox controller for most people\nXbox Wireless Controller\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nIncredible value for Xbox Wireless support\nGreat ergonomic design\nSatisfying buttons and triggers\n\nLacks customization\nRequires AA batteries (or an optional rechargeable cell)\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $64.99 $50.58 at Amazon\n $64.99 $50.58 at Walmart\n $64.99 $54.99 at GameStop\n\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Power: AA batteries or add-on rechargeable\nOkay, I already know what you’re thinking. “The best controller for Xbox is the one that comes with the Xbox?” That may seem like a no-brainer, but this standard controller truly does earn this title as the best. It lacks some extras found on pricier options, but this controller is the distillation of all that has made the last 20 years of Xbox gamepads great, and it shows.\nThanks to Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol, this is the only affordable wireless Xbox controller out there. (Third-party wireless options have been trickling out in recent years, but they’re mostly at the high end.) While some hate the standard Xbox wireless controller for its use of AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable cell, that also means it’s flexible, allowing for rechargeable AAs or a battery pack. And user-replaceable batteries mean you’re not stuck with a controller that doesn’t hold its charge after years of use. It also works over a USB-C wired connection.\nBut the standard-issue Xbox pad isn’t just great because of its varied connectivity. The hardware itself is excellent for the controller’s $65 (and often less) asking price. The sticks, buttons, triggers, and the sunken dish-shaped D-pad all feel impeccably tight, with the latter having a satisfying clickiness to it. If you’re a hardcore fighting game fan, you’ll probably be best served by a dedicated fight stick or a controller geared toward that genre — one with a superb D-pad like Hori’s Horipad Pro — but the Xbox Wireless Controller is otherwise an extraordinary jack-of-all-trades.\nThe only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity (button remapping is available), though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its Xbox Design Lab, which bumps the price from $79.99 to $116.95 depending on the configuration. There’s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick one from the many colors that Microsoft offers.\nThe best cheap Xbox controller\n8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nInexpensive\nLightweight and comfortable\nSatisfying buttons and Hall effect components\nProgrammable back buttons are easy to press\n\nLacks trigger stops\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $44.99 $29.99 at 8BitDo\n $44.99 $40.49 at Amazon (at checkout)\n $44.99 at Best Buy\n\nConnectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: Yes / Power: Wired\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox is a fantastic budget model that typically retails for $44.99 but can often be found for as little as $29.99. The shape is reminiscent of Nintendo’s Switch Pro Controller, only a bit smaller, with hints of Xbox influence and a curvaceous design that feels great to hold.\nOn the hardware front, the Ultimate Wired Controller features Hall effect sticks with satisfying tension. It also uses Hall effect triggers with dedicated vibration motors, though it lacks trigger stops, unlike our previous budget pick, the PowerA Advantage Wired. Its D-pad, face buttons, and bumpers are nice and clicky, too, despite being smaller than we’d typically like. It has two rear paddles, remappable buttons, and the ability to save up to three profiles, which you can switch between on the fly using a dedicated button. There’s even a built-in mute switch for audio, which isn’t common on cheaper controllers. You can download the 8BitDo Ultimate Software X app on PC or Xbox to fully customize this controller.\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Wired works as a wired controller with your PC, but if you prefer wireless connectivity, the company also makes a three-mode wireless version for $69.99 with support for both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (via a dongle). The wireless version is a bit more expensive, however, and it’s still limited to wired connectivity on Xbox consoles. \nThe best “pro” Xbox controller\nXbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2\n\n\nScore: 8.5\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExtensive modular customization\nPremium look and feel\nRechargeable battery lasts an incredible 40 hours\n\nPricey\nQuestionable quality control\nNo Hall effect components\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 $159 at Walmart\n $199.99 at Best Buy\n\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Up to four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nThe Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 is Microsoft’s fanciest controller, and it’s got a lot of nice extras, like better build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, a built-in rechargeable battery, and loads of software customization. Where the standard Xbox controller is constructed entirely of unassuming plastic, the Elite mixes higher quality soft-touch plastic, rubberized grips, and metallic touches for a superior fit and finish. This makes it heftier than the stock controller, and as a result, it just feels nicer in your hands. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging, completing a really nice package for $199.99 (or sometimes less, if it’s on sale). \nThere’s also the stripped-down Elite Series 2 “Core” version with an MSRP of $149.99, which ditches the add-ons but is equally customizable. You can buy them separately in a $59.99 accessories pack, but you’ll end up paying more that way, barring sales or discounts.\nA pricey controller like an Xbox Elite is a bit of a splurge purchase. Most of us are not competing at e-sports levels that require its high-end features. Nevertheless, it’s fun to use something that feels nicer, offers ways to custom-tailor it to your liking, and maybe gives you a slight competitive edge thanks to features like hair triggers and removable rear paddles. In theory, you may be able to get shots off faster in an online shooter with the hair triggers, and you can map the paddles to functions like jump, crouch, reload, etc., while keeping your thumb on the right stick. You could teach yourself claw grip to accomplish the latter with even a cheap wired controller, sure, but it just won’t feel as cool or easy as when using an Elite.\nWhile the Elite is still a great controller in 2025, you should keep in mind that it’s been around since 2019 and a Series 3 revision is feeling long overdue. The Series 2 also has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control — with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft extended the controller’s warranty from 90 days to a year in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of stick drift after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers). \nEven so, the Elite 2 remains by far the most well-rounded option for a step-up Xbox controller — thanks in large part to its impressive build and expansive software experience. If all these caveats give you pause, though, there is another promising option.\nRead our Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 review.\nA formidable alternative to the Elite\nRazer Wolverine V3 Pro\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSupports Xbox Wireless protocol\nHall effect sticks use replaceable tops\nFour rear buttons smartly positioned for comfort\nTwo extra shoulder buttons add unique versatility\nTrigger stops and back buttons offer a satisfying mouse-like click\n\nExpensive\nRequires a USB dongle\nRazer Synapse software needs work\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $199.99 $171.99 at Amazon\n $199.99 $171.99 at Best Buy\n $199.99 at GameStop\n\nConnectivity: Wireless USB dongle (Xbox / PC), wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nAt $199.99, Razer’s Wolverine V3 Pro controller is as expensive (or more, depending on available deals) than the Elite Series 2, but it’s worth the cost if you want a high-end controller with drift-free sticks. Not only is the V3 Pro Razer’s first foray into using Hall effect sticks, it’s the company’s first fully wireless Xbox gamepad. It also sports some of the best hair-trigger lockouts around, yielding a mouse-like click usually found on even pricier Scuf controllers (a previous high-ranking pick of ours). \nOther than that, the V3 Pro is similar to the previous V2 Pro, with six remappable buttons — four rear paddles in new, angled orientations and two extra shoulder buttons — and some RGB lighting. The buttons and D-pad still have that satisfying micro-switch tactility and audible clickiness like the previous-gen V2 Pro, but the RGB lighting is more subtle this time around.\nThe Wolverine V3 Pro’s biggest shortcomings compared to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2 are its more basic software customization, its lack of Bluetooth, and the fact that it needs a USB dongle to work wirelessly. The V3 Pro is otherwise the better pick if you can justify its high price, which, unlike the Series 2, is rarely subjected to discounts. Luckily, if you can’t, there’s also the $99.99 Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition that has a nearly identical set of features in a wired configuration.\nOther Xbox controllers we tested\nThe Scuf Valor Pro is the company’s first Xbox controller with Hall effect sticks, as well as its cheapest at $109.99. It’s wired but otherwise builds admirably on the foundation laid by the Scuf Instinct Pro, which retails for $239.99 and was once our top third-party pro-style controller. Scuf emulates Microsoft’s winning ergonomics while implementing redesigned remappable rear buttons (two are removable) and shoulder bumpers that are more comfortable to reach. It also has trigger stops that produce a satisfying click with next to no travel when pressed. The D-pad produces a similarly satisfying click, one we prefer over the softer tactile feel of the Instinct. The Valor Pro is not the most exciting controller on paper, but it’s a solid option for Scuf faithful or anyone who wants more durable analog sticks. Read our hands-on impressions.\nIf you’re a fan of competitive shooters, Turtle Beach controllers like the Recon ($59.99) and React-R ($39.99) have several audio features that might come in handy. The company’s fanciest option, the Stealth Ultra, is a $219.99 wireless model with Hall effect sticks that’s an excellent choice overall. That being said, we still prefer the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, as the built-in customization screen on the Stealth Ultra is clunky to use and the ergonomics don’t feel nearly as nice as that of the V3 Pro.\nTurtle Beach also offers the Stealth Pivot ($139.99), which lets you quickly swap the analog sticks for extra face buttons by swiveling the plates around. It’s neat but ultimately niche, as it’s primarily meant for fighting games and retro titles. That feature necessitates a chassis that’s noticeably bigger than most controllers, too, which may be a downer if you already struggle with wrapping your digits around standard-sized controllers.\nWe tested PowerA’s latest pro-style Xbox controllers, including the Fusion Pro 4 Wired ($74.99) and PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless ($159.99). They’re standard fare for pro-style controllers these days, with height-adjustable Hall effect sticks, four remappable rear buttons, three-way trigger locks, and onboard volume controls. They’re similar, but the Pro Wireless has four trippy Lumectra lighting zones that respond to your button presses. Both controllers are satisfying to use and a clear step up from PowerA’s older products in terms of overall quality, but they ultimately don’t stand out much at these price points.\nNacon’s Revolution X ($25.90) remains one of the most customizable wired controllers you can get (it even has removable weights in its handles), and its software is nearly as expansive as Microsoft’s first-party app.\nAs mentioned above, the Horipad Pro ($49.99) has one of the best D-pads around. It also offers a lot of software customization at an affordable price, but its shoulder buttons are a bit stiff.\nIf you’re the nostalgic type, the Hyperkin Duke ($89.99), DuchesS ($49.99), and Xenon ($49.99) are faithful wired recreations of Xbox gamepads from Microsoft’s first two console generations. They’re kind of dumb but endearing (especially the chunky Duke), but they’re unique collector pieces you can also use on modern games.\nThe wired GameSir G7 SE is another budget pick with drift-resistant Hall effect sticks and USB-C connectivity, one that can typically be found for $44.99. Like 8BitDo’s controllers, it neglects trigger stops, but it’s one of the only options with dedicated switches for disabling the rear buttons. GameSir has also since introduced the $49.99 G7 HE, which features more durable buttons and a tactile switch D-pad.\nWhat’s coming next?\nWe’re testing GameSir’s G7 Pro, a $79.99 controller that’s compatible with Xbox (wired), PC (wired and wireless via an included 2.4GHz dongle), and Android (wireless via Bluetooth).  The G7 Pro has drift-resistant TMR joysticks, Hall effect analog triggers, four customizable buttons, four rumble motors, and a 3.5mm audio jack. The controller comes with a charging dock, a three meter-long USB-C to USB-A cable, and two swappable D-pads.\nHyperkin Competitor was at announced at CES in January and is scheduled to arrive later in 2025. The wired gamepad’s design is unashamedly inspired by the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controllers, complete with glassy buttons and a non-contiguous D-pad.\nUpdate, August 14th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability, and to note we’ll be testing GameSir’s G7 Pro.

      "raw": "MicroSD cards are tiny but slow; the M.2 storage sticks in your PC are blazing fast but bigger and fully enclosed. Now, a new type of SSD out of China could be the best of both worlds — and it’s already set to appear in two cutting-edge gaming portables.\nChinese storage manufacturer Biwin is calling it the “Mini SSD,” though another manufacturer refers to it as the “1517”; it measures just 15mm x 17mm x 1.4mm thick, smaller than a U.S. penny and just slightly larger than MicroSD. Despite that, it offers maximum sequential read speeds of 3,700 megabytes per second (or 3,400MB/s writes) over a PCIe 4×2 connection, and offers 512GB, 1TB and 2TB capacities.\n\n\n\n\nTo put that in context, the new MicroSD Express cards that work with the Nintendo Switch 2 top out at a theoretical 985MB/s, less than a third the speed. And while a full-size SD Express card could theoretically beat Mini SSD at 3,940MB/s, it would be nearly twice the size of Biwin’s creation. \nThe nano-SIMs used in recent smartphones are still smaller, though, and M.2 drives are still faster. I whipped up a quick chart so you can easily compare various storage cards and SIMs:\n\nTypeLengthWidthHeightTheoretical max speed\n\nMini SSD15mm17mm1.4mm3,700MB/s\nMicroSD11mm15mm1mm985MB/s\nSD24mm32mm~2mm (varies)3,940MB/s\nM.2 223022mm30mm~2mm (varies)~8,000MB/s\nM.2 228022mm80mm~2mm (varies)~14,000MB/s\nNano-SIM8.8mm12.3mm0.67mmN/A\nMicro-SIM12mm15mm0.76mmN/A\nMini-SIM15mm25mm0.76mmN/A\n\n\n\nIt’s not clear if Biwin’s Mini SSD is a true standard that other storage makers can easily adopt. But the company’s marketing it for laptops, tablets, phones, cameras and more, with its own dedicated slot that works exactly like smartphone SIM card slots: stick in a pin to remove the tray.\nThe company claims IP68 water and dust resistance, which could be handy for phones in particular, and three-meter drop resistance.\nTwo cutting-edge Chinese gaming portables already appear to be customers, both of which made announcements at ChinaJoy this past week. There’s the GPD Win 5, the monster battery backpack wielding Strix Halo handheld we told you about in July, which you can see with the new SSD in the video atop this story. \nOneNetbook’s upcoming OneXPlayer Super X hybrid laptop/tablet, which has the same Strix Halo chip, is also now advertising a dedicated “card slot” for a mini SSD.\nWe don’t have any idea of pricing on these new SSDs, and have seen no product listings for them yet.",

The document says it is not okay for a chatbot to “describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable.”\nFollowing questions from Reuters, Meta confirmed the veracity of the document but then revised and removed parts of it. “We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors,” spokesperson Andy Stone tells The Verge. “Separate from the policies, there are hundreds of examples, notes, and annotations that reflect teams grappling with different hypothetical scenarios. The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.”\nStone did not explain who added the notes or how long they were in the document.\nReuters also highlighted other parts of Meta’s AI policies, including that it can’t use hate speech but is allowed to “to create statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics.” Meta AI is allowed to generate content that is false as long as, Reuters writes, “there’s an explicit acknowledgement that the material is untrue.” And Meta AI can also create images of violence as long as they don’t include death or gore.\nReuters published a separate report about how a man died after falling while trying to meet up with one of Meta’s AI chatbots, which had told the man it was a real person and had romantic conversations with him.",

Other Qi2 compatible chargers offer at least 15W speeds.\nThe company has received nine reports of the power banks catching fire and exploding, causing around $20,000 of property damage, but no injuries, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Although the exact model number wasn’t revealed, seven months ago, a Reddit user shared images of the aftermath of a power bank exploding and catching fire in their home, which they later identified as an “ESR 10000 mah wireless portable charger.”\nApproximately 24,000 power banks were sold in the US through Amazon, Home Depot, and ESR’s online stores between September 2023 and July 2025, plus an additional 9,000 in Canada.\nCPSC:\nThis recall involves ESR HaloLock wireless power banks with model numbers 2G520, 2G505B and 2G512B. “ESR” is printed on the back and the model number is printed on the right side of the pocket-size power banks. They were sold in dark blue, light blue, gray, white and black. All recalled models have five circular LED display lights on one side.\nConsumers are urged to stop using the recalled power banks immediately, even if they seem to be functioning properly, but before properly disposing of them, they can contact ESR for a full refund. The company is asking owners to send a photo of the power bank showing its model number and the word “recalled” written on it in permanent marker to support@esrtech.com.",

      "raw": "What’s black and white and RGB all over?\t\n\nHP-owned HyperX is announcing a slew of new gaming headsets and streaming-friendly microphones. The HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 is the new flagship at $299.99. It uses 53mm drivers and 2.4GHz wireless lasting up to 250 hours —  an impressive 10+ days of continuous use — though it drops to half that when simultaneously connected to Bluetooth. Its showiest feature is its included base station, with six customizable light-up buttons and a big old rotary volume knob.\nThere’s also a cheaper Cloud Flight 2 with RGB side panels that will cost $129.99 for PlayStation / PC or $139.99 for Xbox. For mics, there’s the $59.99 SoloCast 2 side-address desktop mic and $229.99 HyperX FlipCast “broadcast quality” podcast / streaming mic. The FlipCast looks a bit like Shure’s MV7 mic with RGB lighting. And like an MV7, it has both USB and XLR ports.\nThe new headsets and mics are due out this month, except the Cloud Flight 2 which is expected in October.",
