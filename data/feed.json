      "raw": "Microsoft first introduced a dark mode option in Windows 10 in 2016, but there were still plenty of areas of the operating system that looked like a mish-mash of light and dark modes. Nearly a decade later, the latest preview build of Windows 11 now includes even more darkened UI elements.\nWindows watcher Phantomofearth spotted updated file operation dialogs with a dark theme. If you’re copying files or deleting them, these dialogs will finally have a dark mode instead of light-themed prompt. It’s clearly a work in progress though, as the buttons on these prompts still have light buttons instead of dark ones.\n\n\nWindows 11's file operation (copy, access denied, etc.) dialogs are FINALLY getting support for dark mode! Here's how the dialogs look in dark mode at this point, hidden in build 26100.5061.\nAlso notice the light buttons in the top right, still a work in progress of course. pic.twitter.com/3D00lWIJcn\n— phantomofearth 🌳 (@phantomofearth) August 15, 2025\n\n\nMicrosoft hasn’t officially announced any improvements to its Windows 11 dark mode, but these small changes could indicate a broader overhaul is coming in time for the 25H2 update later this year. The Control Panel, Run prompt, and file properties UI are all still stuck in light mode, so hopefully Microsoft finds the time after nearly 10 years to address these, too.\nI’m not holding out much hope, though. It took Microsoft a few years to even add a dark mode to File Explorer in Windows 10, after the OS shipped with a mixture of light and dark modes. Apple has long had a consistent dark mode in macOS, since it shipped with macOS Mojave in 2018. A new Liquid Glass redesign is even on the way later this year, with a bigger focus on translucency.",

      "raw": "Some people like to stay on the cutting edge of technology. If that’s you, you already know that Google is going to officially unveil its Pixel 10 phones (including a new Fold) during its August 20th event. But if you’re someone who prefers to use these opportunities to save on last-gen tech, you’ve been rewarded with a sweet deal on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The base 256GB version in obsidian (black) is down to $1,199 at Amazon and Best Buy, which is 33 percent off its original $1,799 price. It was selling for $100 more just last week.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799 $1199 at Amazon (256GB)\n $1799 $1199 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $1799 at Google (256GB)\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold was a big leap forward compared to Google’s first-gen foldable, touting a lightweight design that looks and feels like a normal phone before you unfold it. One of its main drawbacks was that, despite its high original price, you don’t get the same great cameras in the cheaper Pixel 9 Pro (which, by the way, is only $599 at Best Buy). They’re still good, mind you, but reviewer Allison Johnson said during her testing that its telephoto lens produced softer images by comparison, and low-light photos were less detailed. Drawbacks aside, she was eager to recommend the foldable phone at its original $1,800 price.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is nearly upon us, and it’ll likely deliver some sizeable improvements. Google itself has already shown off its design in YouTube clips, and it’s very similar to the model on sale now. However, there’s a rumor that it might have an IP68 rating, which would make it dustproof. Dust was the kryptonite for early foldable models, but the tech has apparently come a long way since then, so this would be a huge selling point in favor of the new model if it’s true.\nRead our full Pixel 9 Pro Fold review.\nOther Verge-approved deals for your weekend\nWe had some tough (but warranted) words for the Windows version of the Lenovo Legion Go S gaming handheld in our review. The Verge’s Sean Hollister summed it up by saying it “feels good, plays bad,” which I echo in my Polygon review from earlier this year. One of Sean’s main complaints is the exorbitant $730 price that Lenovo was charging, especially since its specs aren’t all that impressive compared to the Steam Deck, and don’t get us started on the pain of using Windows 11 in handheld mode. However, its recent $300 off price drop at Best Buy to $499.99 makes it easier to overlook its faults. This model has AMD’s Ryzen Z2 Go chip, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It’s a decent value now considering that the version with SteamOS instead of Windows 11 costs $599.99, yet includes half the RAM and storage, though we’d still recommend picking a system with a Z1 Extreme chip. Also, note that Valve told us it doesn’t officially support SteamOS on the Windows model.\nIf you’re looking for your first — or next — Sonos speaker, there aren’t too many deals worth flagging on new units right now. One good refurbished deal has come to the surface, though, and it’s on the Sonos One SL, which is $119 at Wellbots for Verge readers. Enter the code SONOSVERGE40 at checkout to knock the price down from $159. This is an appealing deal because it beats the current prices at Sonos’ own refurbished outlet, and because it comes with a one-year warranty through Sonos — just as new speakers do. The 2019 One SL can be used alone, or synced up with other Sonos Wi-Fi speakers through the company’s app. It lacks a microphone, so you can’t bark voice commands at it. Read our Sonos One review.\nThose who own a 4K Blu-ray player, like the Panasonic DP-UB420-K, can add more flicks to their library of discs on the cheap over at Gruv. The shopping site (which is owned by Universal Pictures) is offering a bunch of 4K Blu-ray titles in a “3 for $30” sale, making each one just $10 before tax and shipping. Just to give you some examples of visually-stunning films that are eligible, there’s Dunkirk, Crazy Rich Asians, The Matrix Resurrections, and more.",

      "raw": "You can get a great budget device these days if you know how to pick your priorities. | Image: The Verge\t\n\nSome of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets. They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.\nBudget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever. You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world.\nWhat compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.\n\nThe best cheap iPhone\nThe best Android phone under $500\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nOther budget phones to consider\n\nThe best cheap iPhone\niPhone 16E\nThe iPhone 16E is the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, bringing flagship-level performance for less than the standard 16. We really wish it included MagSafe for $599, but those upgrading from older iPhones will probably be satisfied with what’s included.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nReliable performance\nGood, if limited, camera system\nIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy\n\nNo MagSafe\n$599 feels like $100 too much\nNo ultrawide\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 at Apple\n $599.99 at Best Buy\n $599.99 at Verizon\n\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nIf I were making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly cheap. If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.\nThere’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.\nAnother heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming and the most interesting bits won’t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.\nRead my full iPhone 16E review.\nThe best Android phone under $500\nGoogle Pixel 9A\nThe Pixel 9A adds more robust water resistance and a brighter, bigger screen to what was already a winning formula for a good midrange phone.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nRobust IP68 rating\nSeven years of software updates\nBrighter, bigger screen\n\nMissing a couple of AI features\nAI is occasionally handy, usually weird\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 $399 at Amazon\n $499 $399 at Best Buy\n $499.99 $399 at Google\n\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nGoogle’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right. \nThe phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also received a slight boost to IP68, which means it can withstand a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.\nThe 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A’s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin.\nRead my full Google Pixel 9A review.\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nOnePlus 13R\nThe OnePlus 13R is a pared-down version of the company’s flagship phone, and it offers excellent battery life and a great screen for the price.\n\n\nScore: 6\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent battery life\nGreat screen for the price\nSix years of security updates\n\nNo wireless charging\nOnly splash-resistant\nFewer OS updates than Google and Samsung\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599.99 $499.99 at Amazon\n $599.99 $499.99 at Best Buy\n $599.99 $499.99 at OnePlus\n\nScreen: 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP65\nThe OnePlus 13R isn’t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It’s also a little pricier at $599 — although we’ve seen it on sale for $499 for extended periods of time — but for some people, the 13R’s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best big screens in its class, and many people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you’re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.\nThere’s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won’t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against sprays and rain showers, but it isn’t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won’t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience, especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A.\nRead my full OnePlus 13R review.\nOther budget phones to consider\nThe 2025 Motorola Moto G Power offers a lot despite its starting price of $299.99. It features a 6.8-inch LCD display, a 5,000mAh battery, wireless charging support, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is increasingly rare in 2025. Additionally, the device combines both IP68 and IP69 ratings, meaning it’s rated for both submersion in water and exposure to high-pressure water jets and steam, in addition to full protection from dust.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is another perfectly capable phone that doesn’t quite earn a recommendation here. It’s a little outside the scope of this guide at $649 anyway, but you do get a telephoto lens and a nice, big screen for that price. Still, you’re better off saving a bunch and picking up the Pixel 9A or trying to score a trade-in promo for the newer Galaxy S25. Read our review.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A56 recently launched in the US with a starting price of $499. The device has all the makings of a solid midrange phone, including a 6.7-inch OLED display, a 50-megapixel main camera, an Exynos 1580 chip, and a 5,000mAh battery with 45W wired charging. Although we haven’t tested it yet, it has some pretty stiff competition in the form of the Pixel 9A, which also has a starting price of $499.\nWe got our first glimpse of the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G back at CES 2025, and it’s finally in our hands for testing. The device features an Nxtpaper matte LCD screen that’s supposed to be easier on your eyes than a traditional LCD, as it reduces your exposure to blue light. It also features a “Max Ink Mode,” which turns the screen monochrome and silences notifications. This, in turn, can help extend the phone’s battery life to multiple days. Read our initial impressions.\nThe Samsung Galaxy A36 5G is another great choice that recently launched in the US for $399.99. The device sports a big OLED display, a decent midrange Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor, and an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance. Samsung is promising six years of OS and security updates, which is a lot in this price range. Compared to the Galaxy A35 5G, which we previously included in this guide but is no longer available, the A36 5G drops the microSD slot for a second SIM card slot. While we haven’t tested the A36 5G, its predecessor offered a good balance of hardware and price, and the latest release sounds just as compelling.\nUpdate, August 15th: Updated pricing / availability and added a bullet for the Galaxy A36 5G.

      "raw": "The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against Roblox, alleging that the company has “permitted and perpetuated an online environment in which child predators thrive, directly contributing to the widespread victimization of minor children in Louisiana.” \nRoblox sees more than 111.8 million daily active users, and it’s hugely popular with children, with users under 13 comprising nearly 40 percent of players last quarter. However, the platform has come under significant scrutiny over reported failures to protect children on the platform, with Bloomberg publishing a major report last year about predators on Roblox and the investment firm Hindenburg Research alleging that its research revealed “an X-rated pedophile hellscape.” In recent months, Roblox has taken steps to bolster its child safety features, including introducing parent accounts that can manage their child’s account and the ability for parents to block people on their child’s friend list.\nBut Louisiana alleges that Roblox’s “deliberate failure to implement effective safety measures to protect child users from well-documented predatory threats, along with its ongoing failure to warn parents and children of the foreseeable dangers posed by its platform, has directly facilitated the widespread sexual exploitation of minors and inflicted severe, lasting harm upon the children of Louisiana,” according to the complaint.\n“Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,” Attorney General Liz Murrill says. “Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.”\nRoblox spokesperson Kadia Koroma sent the following statement about the lawsuit to The Verge:\nThe assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is categorically untrue. Every day, tens of millions of people around the world use Roblox to learn stem skills, play, and imagine and have a safe experience on our platform. We dedicate vast resources to supporting a safe infrastructure including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior — not only because it’s important to us but because it is such a critical issue and so important to our community. We dispute these allegations and we remain committed to working with Attorney General Murrill to keep kids safe.\nWhile no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous safeguards—such as restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing—to help protect our community. Unfortunately, bad actors will try to circumvent our systems to try to direct users off the platform, where safety standards and moderation practices may differ. We continuously work to block those efforts and to enhance our moderation approaches to promote a safe and enjoyable environment for all users.\nThe company also published an article responding to the lawsuit on its newsroom.\nSeven lawsuits regarding child predator issues have been filed against Roblox in a “little over two weeks,” Bloomberg reports.\nThis week, Roblox published a post on its website about why it removes what it describes as “vigilantes” who try to catch bad actors on Roblox by using tactics “similar to actual predators.” One user, who goes by “Schlep” and says on his X profile that he has contributed to “6 Roblox arrests and counting,” posted screenshots on X last week of what he says was a cease-and-desist notice by Roblox.\nUpdate, August 15th: Added statement from Roblox.",
