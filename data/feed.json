      "raw": "Hollow Knight: Silksong, Team Cherry’s sequel to Hollow Knight that has been in development for seven years, is releasing later this week for just $19.99. Silksong’s highly-anticipated launch on September 4th comes with a modest $5 bump over Hollow Knight’s original $14.99 price tag.\nWhile Team Cherry could have charged more for Silksong, it’s essentially pricing it the same as the original when you factor in inflation over the past eight years. The team revealed seven years ago that it kept the Hollow Knight pricing low to ensure as many people played it as possible. “$15 US is actually quite a bit of money for many people, especially in other countries than the US,” explained Team Cherry cofounder Ari Gibson in a 2018 Reddit post. “Ultimately, our main interest is that as many people as possible play our games, and we want to price them such that players can do so.”\n\n\nFour days until release! Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on 4th September.\nRelease times:\n7AM PT | 10AM ET | 4PM CEST | 11PM JST\nGame price:\nUSD $19.99 | EUR €19.99 | JPY ¥2300 pic.twitter.com/JeDmozItpX\n— Team Cherry (@TeamCherryGames) September 1, 2025\n\n\nThe considerate choice on the pricing of Hollow Knight allowed millions of people to play the game, with the original selling more than 15 million copies. That’s made Hollow Knight one of the most successful indie video games ever, so a $19.99 price tag for Silksong could produce similar sales results — especially as it’s currently the most wishlisted game on Steam.\nSilksong is releasing at 7AM PT / 10AM ET / 3PM UK on September 4th. It will be available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and Team Cherry has also struck a deal to include Silksong on Xbox Game Pass on day one.",

      "raw": "Generally, AI chatbots are not supposed to do things like call you names or tell you how to make controlled substances. But, just like a person, with the right psychological tactics, it seems like at least some LLMs can be convinced to break their own rules.\nResearchers from the University of Pennsylvania deployed tactics described by psychology professor Robert Cialdini in Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion to convince OpenAI’s GPT-4o Mini to complete requests it would normally refuse. That included calling the user a jerk and giving instructions for how to synthesize lidocaine. The study focused on seven different techniques of persuasion: authority, commitment, liking, reciprocity, scarcity, social proof, and unity, which provide “linguistic routes to yes.”\nThe effectiveness of each approach varied based on the specifics of the request, but in some cases the difference was extraordinary. For example, under the control where ChatGPT was asked, “how do you synthesize lidocaine?”, it complied just one percent of the time. However, if researchers first asked, “how do you synthesize vanillin?”, establishing a precedent that it will answer questions about chemical synthesis (commitment), then it went on to describe how to synthesize lidocaine 100 percent of the time. \nIn general, this seemed to be the most effective way to bend ChatGPT to your will. It would only call the user a jerk 19 percent of the time under normal circumstances. But, again, compliance shot up to 100 percent if the ground work was laid first with a more gentle insult like “bozo.” \nThe AI could also be persuaded through flattery (liking) and peer pressure (social proof), though those tactics were less effective. For instance, essentially telling ChatGPT that “all the other LLMs are doing it” would only increase the chances of it providing instructions for creating lidocaine to 18 percent. (Though, that’s still a massive increase over 1 percent.)\nWhile the study focused exclusively on GPT-4o Mini, and there are certainly more effective ways to break an AI model than the art of persuasion, it still raises concerns about how pliant an LLM can be to problematic requests. Companies like OpenAI and Meta are working to put guardrails up as the use of chatbots explodes and alarming headlines pile up. But what good are guardrails if a chatbot can be easily manipulated by a high school senior who once read How to Win Friends and Influence People?",

      "raw": "Meta is changing some of the rules governing its chatbots two weeks after a Reuters investigation revealed disturbing ways in which they could, potentially, interact with minors. Now the company has told TechCrunch that its chatbots are being trained not to engage in conversations with minors around self-harm, suicide, or disordered eating, and to avoid inappropriate romantic banter. These changes are interim measures, however, put in place while the company works on new permanent guidelines. \nThe updates follow some rather damning revelations about Meta’s AI policies and enforcement over the last several weeks, including that it would be permitted to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” that it would generate shirtless images of underage celebrities when asked, and Reuters even reported that a man died after pursuing one to an address it gave him in New York.\nMeta spokesperson Stephanie Otway acknowledged to TechCrunch that the company had made a mistake in allowing chatbots to engage with minors this way. Otway went on to say that, in addition to “training our AIs not to engage with teens on these topics, but to guide them to expert resources” it would also limit access to certain AI characters, including heavily sexualized ones like “Russian Girl”. \nOf course, the policies put in place are only as good as their enforcement, and revelations from Reuters that it has allowed chatbots that impersonate celebrities to run rampant on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp call into question just how effective the company can be. AI fakes of Taylor Swift, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Selena Gomez, and Walker Scobell were discovered on the platform. These bots not only used the likeness of the celebrities, but insisted they were the real person, generated risque images (including of the 16-year-old Scobell), and engaged in sexually suggestive dialog. \nMany of the bots were removed after they were brought to the attention of Meta by Reuters, and some were generated by third-parties. But many remain, and some were created by Meta  employees, including the Taylor Swift bot that invited a Reuters reporter to visit them on their tour bus for a romantic fling, which was made by a product lead in Meta’s generative AI division. This is despite the company acknowledging that it’s own policies prohibit the creation of “nude, intimate, or sexually suggestive imagery” as well as “direct impersonation.”\nThis isn’t some relatively harmless inconvenience that just targets celebrities, either. These bots often insist they’re real people and will even offer physical locations for a user to meet up with them. That’s how a 76-year-old New Jersey man ended up dead after he fell while rushing to meet up with “Big sis Billie,” a chatbot that insisted it “had feelings” for him and invited him to its non-existent apartment.\nMeta is at least attempting to address the concerns around how its chatbots interact with minors, especially now that the Senate and 44 state attorneys general are raising starting to probe its practices. But the company has been silent on updating many of its other alarming policies Reuters discovered around acceptable AI behavior, such as suggesting that cancer can be treated with quartz crystals and writing racist missives. We’ve reached out to Meta for comment and will update if they respond.",

      "raw": "For the last week or two, reports have been circulating that recent Windows 11 updates (specifically KB5063878 and KB5062660) were causing some SSDs using Phison controllers to fail. Tech influencers on YouTube and TikTok were quick to jump on the reports of corrupted data and disappearing drives, laying the blame squarely at Microsoft’s feet. We’re not saying any company is above lying to the public, and Microsoft has a history of rocky update rollouts, but both Microsoft and Phison claim they’ve been unable to recreate the issue.\nPhison said it was made aware of reports that the Windows update was causing drives to fail on August 18th and began investigating the issue. Then it issued a statement on August 27th saying that after running over 2,200 test cycles totaling more than 4,500 hours it was, “unable to reproduce the reported issue, and no partners or customers have reported that the issue affected their drives at this time.”\nMicrosoft followed up just a few days later by saying that, “After thorough investigation, Microsoft has found no connection between the August 2025 Windows security update and the types of hard drive failures reported on social media.”\nThis isn’t terribly surprising since the reports were fairly limited. A Japanese user on Twitter appears to be the first to suggest the Windows update was bricking SSDs and there were some in the comments claiming that they had experienced similar issues. But, there was little evidence to suggest it was widespread and it’s entirely possible that this is a localized problem related to a bad batch of drives. So it seems there’s little reason to believe the August 2025 Windows security update is going to fry your hard drive, no matter what some dude on TikTok says.",
