      "raw": "It used to be easy to pick an Apple Watch. All you had to do was choose whether you wanted the larger model or the smaller one. Then Apple added optional cellular connectivity. Then, a more affordable Watch SE (now in its second generation) and, in 2022, the rugged Apple Watch Ultra (also now in its second generation). Suddenly, there are lots of options.\nNow that the Series 10 has been out for nearly a year, perfectly good older versions of the Apple Watch are regularly getting discounted as retailers try to empty their inventory. You may also see more refurbished versions of these older models pop up. If you’re interested in more premium materials, like stainless steel, this is a great way to get a fancier version of last year’s watch. You won’t be missing out on too much, either. The past few years have seen iterative updates in terms of hardware — and the bulk of new features come from software updates. With that said, keep in mind that the latest version of watchOS, watchOS 11, doesn’t support the Series 4, 5, and first-gen SE. The same can be said of watchOS 26, which is slated to arrive in the fall.\nBuying refurbished is one way that you may be able to upgrade from an older model without sacrificing blood oxygen. Due to a patent battle with Masimo, new Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US after January 18th, 2024, no longer have this feature. This is not a big deal for most people, but if it’s important to you, older watches and Series 9 and Ultra 2 units sold by Apple before January 18th, 2024, still retain the feature. (As do watches overseas. The ban only impacts US units.)\nWhat about the newer Series 10? In a nutshell, it’s got a bigger screen, it’s about 10 percent thinner, and it’s lighter than previous models. It’s also got an FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature. There are a ton of new colors and finishes, with titanium replacing stainless steel. All in all, it’s an iterative update but one we find meaningful in terms of readability and wearability.\nSo much choice can lead to analysis paralysis. But don’t worry. I’ve tested every single version of the Apple Watch you can buy right now — in addition to basically every other fitness watch and smartwatch on the market — and can steer you in the right direction. Just keep in mind that Apple typically announces new Apple Watch models in September, meaning it might be wise to hold off just a bit longer before making your decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you get an Apple Watch?\nApple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?\nThe best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget\nThe best Apple Watch for kids\nThe best Apple Watch for older relatives\nWhat’s coming next\n\nShould you get an Apple Watch?\nThe Apple Watch is the best overall smartwatch for iPhone users. Many smartwatches are better than the Apple Watch for hardcore athletes, even with the Ultra models in the mix. But other watches fall short when it comes to productivity, safety features, controlling your smart home, and interacting with other Apple devices and services. And the Apple Watch has the most robust third-party app ecosystem of any smartwatch on the market. \nBy their nature, wearables are incredibly personal devices — and you won’t get the benefits of an Apple Watch if you don’t wear it regularly. The last thing you want is to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing that ends up collecting dust in a drawer. The best way to avoid this is to stack the deck in your favor and prioritize comfort. Before you try to start mulling over which Apple Watch model you should get, take a second to figure out which size and strap material will best fit your wrist. \nThe SE and Series watches come in two sizes each. The SE comes in 40mm and 44mm, while the Series 7, 8, and 9 are 41mm and 45mm. The new Series 10 ups the size again to 42mm and 46mm. The larger models are better for readability, while the smaller ones are more comfortable for those with petite wrists. Both the SE and the Series watches have aluminum cases, but the Series 10 now comes in titanium, too. (Older models come in stainless steel.) Most people will be fine with aluminum, but if you’re clumsy or very active, you’ll benefit from the extra durability offered by stainless steel or titanium. You might also just like the look better — and that’s valid since watches are a personal piece of tech. Just be prepared to pay a few hundred bucks more for that.\nAs for straps, we recommend the nylon sport loop, as it’s the most breathable option, has the easiest clasp, and is less irritating than the silicone options, which is great for sensitive skin. If you’re looking for more fashionable options, we recommend checking out Amazon or Etsy for a wider variety of styles and more affordable pricing. You’ll want to check third parties for leather accessories, too, as Apple announced in 2023 that it would no longer make leather accessories in a bid to achieve carbon neutrality.\nThe Ultra and Ultra 2 both come in one size — 49mm — and with titanium cases. They come with their own special straps, too: the Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band. As their names suggest, they’re geared toward runners, hikers, and divers, but you can pick whichever one suits your fancy. We recommend the Trail Loop, as it’s the lightest and most versatile of the three. All the Ultra straps work with any 44mm or 45mm Series watch, and the Ultra is compatible with any 44mm or 45mm Apple Watch strap.\nAnd while the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch you can get as an iPhone user, you can also always check out our fitness tracker buying guide.\nApple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?\nApple Watch Series 10\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBigger display but not bulky\nWide-angle OLED is neat\nMuch faster charging\nSleep apnea detection has potential\n\nLack of blood oxygen (in US) may impact your upgrade plans\nAnother year of minor updates\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399 $299 at Amazon\n $399 $299 at Walmart\n $399 $299 at Best Buy\n\nThe latest Apple Watch, the Series 10, is a more modest update. It primarily focuses on making the watches more comfortable while adding a larger, wide-angle OLED display. If you’re upgrading from an older model, you’ll definitely notice that you can see more from the wrist. The speakers now play music and podcasts, and voice isolation on calls has been improved. There’s an added depth and water temperature sensor, which makes it a better companion for water sports as well. Fast charging has also been meaningfully improved. On the health front, Apple has brought FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection to the watch, along with the Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nWe recommend the second-gen Apple Watch SE for younger people and first-time smartwatch buyers. If you’re upgrading from an earlier Apple Watch, you want an always-on display, or you want more advanced health tracking, you should consider the Series 10. And if you want the brightest screen, the best durability and battery life, and even more advanced fitness features, we recommend the Ultra 2.\nThe Series 10 is Apple’s flagship smartwatch. Compared to earlier models, it’s going to get you the fastest processor, quick charging, a larger display, and all the latest sensors. Prices start at $399 for the 42mm version and $429 for the 46mm, but you can often find both models on sale. Adding LTE connectivity will add $100 to the price, plus whatever your carrier charges for the service. Prices start at $699 for the polished titanium models.\nThe second-gen SE has a nylon composite back, which helps shave $30 off the original’s price. You can get a cellular version, and it supports many of the same advanced features as the last-last-gen Series 8, like fall detection, emergency calling, Fitness Plus, Apple Pay, and Apple Watch For Your Kids. The biggest difference is that it lacks an always-on display, an EKG sensor, temperature sensors, and a SpO2 sensor. The display is also slightly smaller on both sizes of the SE. It starts at $249 for the 40mm and $279 for the 44mm, but you can regularly find them for cheaper. Adding LTE will tack on an extra $50 in addition to your carrier’s fees. \n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nS8 chip is still speedy enough\nOffers the bulk of watchOS 11 features\nExcellent entry-level watch\n\nThe bezels are thick\nSmaller display isn’t good for elderly relatives\nNo always-on display\nFewer sensors\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $169 at Amazon\n $249 $169 at Walmart\n $249 $169 at Best Buy\n\nTo be perfectly honest, if you’re young and healthy, you’re not really missing out on EKG or SpO2. (Also, newer watches sold in the US currently have the SpO2 feature disabled anyway.) The SE’s heart rate sensor is still capable of providing abnormal heart rate alerts. Right now, Apple’s SpO2 features are limited to spot checks. There’s not much you can do with that information, and unlike the EKGs, this is only cleared for general wellness purposes. It will not be able to replace a fingertip pulse oximeter, and you should never use it in this way.\nThe main purpose of the EKG sensor is to enable atrial fibrillation detection — and if your doctor’s given you a clean bill of health, you will likely only use this feature once or twice. According to the American Heart Association, the biggest risk factors for AFib are advanced age, underlying heart conditions, high blood pressure, family history, and sleep apnea, among other lifestyle choices. If this doesn’t apply to you, the SE is still going to give you an excellent health tracking experience and all the same smart features. Young, first-time buyers may as well save the extra cash — so long as the lack of an always-on display isn’t a deal-breaker. \nYou can’t really see much of a difference between the Ultra on the left and the Ultra 2 on the right.\t\nThere are some situations where opting for the Series 10 is the better choice, however, like if you want an always-on display or need to have the latest and greatest. The larger, wide-angle OLED display also provides much better readability for anyone with bad eyesight. It’s also the better choice if you have a heart condition or are at a higher risk of developing AFib. If you suspect you may have sleep apnea, you’ll also need a Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 to access that feature.\nApple Watch Ultra 2\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nThe Modular Ultra face is a data nerd’s dream\nPrecision Finding\nMinor Siri and screen brightness improvements\nDouble-tap gesture is great\n\nNo pink\nThe minor changes feel even more minor with the Ultra\nNeed iPhone 15 or 16 for Precision Finding\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $649.99 at Amazon (with Alpine Loop)\n $799 $649.99 at Amazon (with Trail Loop)\n $799 $649.99 at Amazon (with Ocean Band)\n\nThe Ultra 2 currently sits atop the lineup as Apple’s premium smartwatch. It’s visually distinct from both the Series and SE — and at 49mm, it’s the biggest of them all. Not only that, it has increased durability, water resistance, and a raised lip to protect the flat display. It also has an additional water temperature and depth sensor for divers, three microphones, and two speakers, which enable the Siren. It’s also got the Action button, which can be programmed for various activities, pause workouts, and trigger the Siren.\nAt $799, the Ultra 2 is the most expensive Apple Watch, but every model comes equipped with LTE capability. If you have an Ultra and are wondering if you should upgrade to the second-gen model, the answer is no. If you have an Ultra 2 and are wondering if you should upgrade to the new black color, the answer is also no. (Admittedly, it does look quite nice.) It’s too soon, and there’s not enough of a difference. We recommend the Ultra 2 for new buyers only.\nWhat about blood oxygen?\nAs of January 18th, 2024, Apple no longer sells new Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 models with the blood oxygen feature in the US. That’s because Apple is currently undergoing a patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo. The International Trade Commission has ruled that Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature infringe on two of Masimo’s patents — and are therefore subject to an import ban.\nThis doesn’t affect watches sold outside of the US, or the Apple Watch SE, which doesn’t have the blood oxygen sensor in question. Watches sold by third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon may be unaffected if they’re selling refurbished models or happen to have pre-ban Series 9 or Ultra 2 inventory. You can tell if a model doesn’t have the blood oxygen feature if the part numbers end in LW/A. It also does not affect the newer sleep apnea detection feature, which utilizes the accelerometer.\nThat said, the blood oxygen feature is not that vital a feature on any wearable just yet. Many either have spot check features only or passively track your SpO2 overnight and give you an average in the morning. They cannot and should not replace fingertip pulse oximeters. But if the feature is important to you, you may want to look into alternatives from Garmin, the Fitbit Charge 6, the Withings ScanWatch 2, or the Oura Ring.\nIf battery life is your highest priority, getting either Ultra is the best choice. In testing, we got up to 60 hours without Low Power Mode enabled. However, if you use about one hour of GPS tracking a day or take calls, you’re more likely to get around two days. It’s also the better choice if you frequently hike, dive, or run trails. While marketed as a hardcore watch for explorers, in our opinion, it’s more of an aspirational watch for weekend warriors and intermediate athletes — or anyone who wants to be at that level.\nYou’re not going to beat either Ultra on battery life, but you can stretch out the battery life on the Series 4 or later with Low Power Mode. You can even sleep track with Low Power Mode on, though it’ll turn off background health sensors. With the Series 10, Apple has improved fast charging as well. Official estimates are that you can get 0 to 80 percent in 30 minutes, which roughly matches our real-world testing. Just be sure you’re using the correct charging accessories.\nIf you have smaller wrists, you may want to opt for the Series 10 as it has fast charging and is more comfortable to wear long-term. Faster charging comes in clutch when you’re about to head to bed and you’ve only got 15 percent battery. Also, if you’re the type that values futureproofing, the Series 10’s hardware will be able to support newer features for a longer period of time thanks to its newer processor. This is why folks who love their watch and are looking to upgrade from a Series 4 or older should also pick the Series 10. If you’re already in the habit of wearing the watch daily, you’ll get more mileage out of it as the SE is more of a gateway device, and the Ultra is overkill for the average Joe.  \nThe best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nS8 chip is still speedy enough\nOffers the bulk of watchOS 11 features\nExcellent entry-level watch\n\nThe bezels are thick\nSmaller display isn’t good for elderly relatives\nNo always-on display\nFewer sensors\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $169 at Amazon\n $249 $169 at Walmart\n $249 $169 at Best Buy\n\nThe latest Watch SE is the way to go for people who want to futureproof their hardware without breaking the bank (so long as you’re okay forgoing a larger display). You’re getting the same processor as the Series 8 and original Ultra, plus Crash Detection.\nWhile the second-gen SE is an excellent watch, it’s not always the right choice. It’s meant to be a gateway watch, so it’s best suited to folks who are completely new to the Apple Watch and want to spend as little as possible. If you’re looking to upgrade from an older watch but don’t want to pony up for the Series 10, there’s another option: buying a used or refurbished Apple Watch.\nBuying secondhand devices is also better for the environment and a more affordable way to get more expensive materials. Materials like sapphire glass, stainless steel, or titanium can add hundreds to the price of a new watch. It’s also a good way to save money if you’re just not excited by the Series 10’s features but want more than what the SE offers.\n\nIt’ll take some patience to find the best price and the model you want. After all, you’re limited by what’s available. However, there are several sites that offer older models. Sometimes, you can also find deals and sales as well. If you’re worried about getting scammed, look for deals recommended by sources you trust (cough, cough, Verge Deals). Apple also sells its own refurbished models, which come with a full Apple warranty and are generally in a “like new” condition, though the selection can be limited, and you likely won’t pay less than a new SE. Sites like Back Market will also allow you to sort by condition and obtain a 12-month warranty.\nIf you’re considering a used or refurbished model, we recommend the Series 7 or Series 8, as they offer a larger screen for improved readability. We also recommend that you use $250 as a benchmark since that’s the price of a base model Watch SE. With that said, if you’re getting premium materials, going a little higher is fine. Do not get a refurbished Series 5 or older. Although you can find them for $100 (sometimes less!), they can’t run the latest software and even struggle to update the newest software they do support.\nThe best Apple Watch for kids\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, LTE)\nThe latest SE for 2022 borrows a few features from the Series 8, including the same chipset and Crash Detection feature, but it’s an otherwise subtle upgrade from the last-gen SE.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nS8 chip is still speedy enough\nOffers the bulk of watchOS 11 features\nExcellent entry-level watch\n\nThe bezels are thick\nSmaller display isn’t good for elderly relatives\nNo always-on display\nFewer sensors\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 $219 at Amazon\n $299 $219 at Best Buy\n $299 $219.99 at Target\n\nIf you want your child to have an Apple Watch, we recommend picking a cellular Apple Watch SE or, if you can find one, a refurbished Series 4, 5, or 6 with cellular. All of these watches come in smaller sizes than the Series 7, 8, or 9, which will likely better fit their wrist. Also, the lower price will give you better peace of mind if you have a rambunctious kid. They likely won’t need many of the marquee features found in watchOS 11, either. That being said, if you want the most futureproof options, the second-gen SE and Series 6 are the best choices.\nSince you’re buying for children, you’ll likely want to use Apple Watch For Your Kids — formerly known as Family Setup — as it will give you greater parental controls. However, there are technical specifications that you’ll need to match in order to use it. You’ll need a cellular version of the device, and it must at least support watchOS 7. Apple’s support page also states that you need a Series 4 or later or an Apple Watch SE to use it.\nIf you opt for the family route, not every feature will be available. While you can get Apple Pay and certain health features, you will not get the following: health data sharing, respiratory rate, irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, Cycle Tracking, Sleep, Blood Oxygen, Podcasts, Remote, News, Home, and Shortcuts.\nThe best Apple Watch for older relatives\nApple Watch Series 10 (42mm, LTE)\nThe Series 10’s display is comparable in size to the Ultra 2’s but the watch itself is roughly 30 percent thinner and half the weight.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBigger display but not bulky\nWide-angle OLED is neat\nMuch faster charging\nSleep apnea detection has potential\n\nLack of blood oxygen (in US) may impact your upgrade plans\nAnother year of minor updates\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 $399 at Amazon\n $499 $399 at Walmart\n $499 $399 at Best Buy\n\nThis can be a tricky one, but we recommend a cellular Series 9 or 10. \nFor starters, the larger screen is much easier on the eyes. You can also increase the text size to be larger than on the SE or older Apple Watches. The always-on display aids accessibility, especially if arm mobility is a consideration. You’ll also get the full suite of health features, including irregular heartbeat alerts, walking steadiness, EKGs, fall detection, sleep apnea detection, and emergency calling. These models also have the double tap feature and improved Siri functionality, which may be helpful for elderly relatives with dexterity issues.\nYou can use the Ultra, but you should keep its size and weight in mind. Depending on your loved one’s wrist size and health, it may not make sense. Both sizes of the Series 10 have comparable screen sizes but are much lighter and more comfortable to wear. \nIf your older relative has an iPhone and you’re hoping to use this for health reasons, we also don’t recommend using Apple’s family setup. That’s because you cannot use features like irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, and health data sharing. If your relative doesn’t have an iPhone, however, it’s a fine option. You’ll still get high and low heart rate notifications, walking steadiness, and fall detection.\nWhat’s coming next\nIn previous years, Apple has held an event in early September to show off its forthcoming product lineup. While the latest iPhones usually hog the spotlight, the fall event remains a prime time for the company to trot out the newest Apple Watch models, many of which launch shortly thereafter alongside Apple’s latest OS updates.\nSo, what can we expect this year? The Apple Watch Series 11 seems like a sure bet, and there have been murmurs regarding an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and a third-gen Apple Watch SE. Recently uncovered evidence in the fifth iOS 26 developer beta lends some credence to this report, suggesting the Ultra 3 could have a display resolution of 422 x 514, which is slightly bigger than the 410 x 502 resolution on the Ultra 2. The rumor mill has been pretty quiet outside of that, but if previous events are anything to go by, we can expect Apple’s refreshed lineup to offer updated design elements, better battery life, and new health features.\nUpdate, August 13th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of Apple’s heavily rumored iPhone event.

      "raw": "There’s a sore loser in this popularity contest.\t\n\nElon Musk says that his artificial intelligence company xAI “will take immediate legal action” against Apple for allegedly manipulating its App Store rankings to the advantage of rival AI apps. In a series of X posts on Monday night, Musk suggested that Apple was “playing politics” by not placing either X or xAI’s Grok chatbot in the App Store’s list of recommended iOS apps, and that he had no choice but to file a lawsuit.\n“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,” Musk said. “Why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?,” the xAI CEO asked Apple in another post, which is now pinned to his profile.\nMusk provided no evidence for his claims, and it’s unclear if he has made good on his threats and filed the lawsuit yet.\nAn Apple statement reported by Bloomberg and attributed to an unnamed spokesperson says the App Store is “designed to be fair and free of bias… we feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria.” The Verge has also reached out to xAI and OpenAI for comment.\nAt the time of writing, ChatGPT is listed as Apple’s top free iPhone app in the US, with Grok ranked as the sixth. China’s DeepSeek AI briefly managed to take the top App Store position from ChatGPT in January, however, disproving Musk’s claim that it would be impossible for other AI apps to do so.\nAccusations of meddling from Musk are ironic, given allegations about alterations made to X after he acquired the company in 2022, then known as Twitter. A research study in 2024 suggested that X’s algorithm was manipulated to boost posts from Musk’s account. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk’s posts by sharing a Platformer report from 2023 that similarly found Musk had a system built to promote his X posts to the entire platform’s userbase. In June, the “maximally truth-seeking” Grok chatbot was also found to be consulting Musk’s opinion before providing answers to controversial questions around topics like Israel and Palestine, US immigration, and abortion.\nThis isn’t the first time that Musk has beefed with Apple and OpenAI. Musk was an early founder at OpenAI, and previously targeted the AI startup via lawsuits and a unanimously rejected $97.4 billion buyout offer after taking issue with its pivot to being a profit-driven business. Following OpenAI’s partnership with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads, and Macs last year, Musk threatened to ban Apple devices at his companies if OpenAI’s tech was fused with Apple’s OS.\nUpdate, August 12th: Added statement from Apple given to Bloomberg.",

      "raw": "Just a few days after administrators announced that the “federal Judiciary is taking additional steps to strengthen protections for sensitive case documents in response to recent escalated cyberattacks,” the New York Times reports investigators have found evidence Russia is “at least partially responsible” for a recent hack. Politico reported on the breach last week, saying it was “believed to have exposed sensitive court data across multiple U.S. states” and that while the system’s managers had been aware of its impact since around July 4th, they are still trying to figure out its full extent. \nSearches by the attackers reportedly included cases “involving people with Russian and Eastern European surnames,” and may have compromised sealed records that weren’t publicly available. \nAfter the SolarWinds breach in 2021, new procedures called for highly sensitive documents to be filed using paper or a secure electronic device, and not uploaded to CM/ECF. In 2022, the DOJ reportedly informed the judiciary of another ongoing breach.\nAccording to the Times, district court chief judges were warned last month to keep cases with documents “related to criminal activity with an overseas tie” off of the usual document management system for federal cases, which is made up of the Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF) where files are uploaded and managed, as well as PACER, a database that’s available to the public. It points to this order issued Friday by Eastern District of New York chief judge Margo Brodie, saying that, until further notice, “criminal cases and in cases related to criminal investigations are prohibited from being filed in CM/ECF,” and are instead to be uploaded to a separate system that doesn’t connect to PACER.\nLast week’s notice from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said:\nThe vast majority of documents filed with the Judiciary’s electronic case management system are not confidential and indeed are readily available to the public, which is fundamental to an open and transparent judicial system. However, some filings contain confidential or proprietary information that are sealed from public view.\nThese sensitive documents can be targets of interest to a range of threat actors. To better protect them, courts have been implementing more rigorous procedures to restrict access to sensitive documents under carefully controlled and monitored circumstances.",

      "raw": "In 2025, you might wonder if Fitbit is still relevant. Despite getting acquired by Google, Fitbit remains one of the most recognizable names in the industry. Fitbit trackers aren’t meant for the most hardcore of athletes, but they’re still excellent devices for tracking overall activity as well as monitoring certain health and wellness metrics like EKGs and blood oxygen levels. \nThat said, this is a transitional period from the Fitbit of old to whatever Fitbit will be in the future. 2023, in particular, was a messy year. There were multiple Fitbit server outages, and I wasn’t impressed with the decision to sunset legacy community features like challenges or the fact that all Fitbit accounts will soon require you to log in via Google. Speaking of which, the Fitbit-to-Google account migration started in 2023 and is required if you buy newer products like the Fitbit Charge 6 or Google Pixel Watch 3. The Fitbit app also got a new, more Google-like makeover, which didn’t go over well with many users. (Google has since made adjustments based on feedback.) And in 2024, much of Fitbit’s leadership, including co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman, left the company as roughly a thousand Google employees were laid off.\nYou can look at how Google has handled the Nest acquisition as a road map to how things are going. The Googlefication of Fitbit will continue, but there are reasons to stick with its trackers in the meantime. Fitbit trackers are relatively affordable, especially since they often go on sale. All the devices also come with a free trial to Fitbit Premium, the company’s subscription service that provides guided workouts, meditations, and access to more in-depth metrics. So far, it appears Google takes its Pixel Watch lineup seriously, too. With the Pixel Watch 2, the company expanded extended warranty access and improved replacement options. You just have to go in with eyes wide open.\nIf you’re not dead set on a Fitbit in particular, check out our guide to the best fitness trackers and watches.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Fitbit smartwatch\nBest budget Fitbit\nBest Fitbit fitness tracker\nBest Fitbit for kids\nWhat’s coming next\nShould you even buy a Fitbit right now?\n\nBest Fitbit smartwatch\nPixel Watch 3 (41mm, Bluetooth)\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nWe finally get a bigger size!\nModerate battery improvements\nLots of neat Google integrations\nGood running updates\nReadiness and Cardio Load scores not locked behind paywall\n\nIt’s best with a Pixel phone\nLoss of Pulse detection is Europe-only for now\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.99 $269.85 at Amazon\n $349.99 $269.99 at Best Buy\n $349.99 $269.99 at Target\n\nThe existence of the Pixel Watch, now in its third generation, has thrown a wrench into Fitbit’s smartwatch lineup. Technically, it’s a Google product, but Google owns Fitbit, so they’re all Google products now. Fitbit powers all of the Pixel Watch’s health and fitness features. But really, this is the smartwatch that Fitbit never could manage to build on its own.\nThe Pixel Watch 3 is a significant update over its predecessors. It finally feels like Google’s no longer playing catch-up to its rivals. This time around, the screens are brighter, the bezels are smaller, and there’s now a 45mm size for larger wrists. The larger size doesn’t look chunky, either. Internally, the processor and health sensors are the same as those of the Pixel Watch 2, though the third-gen device has an ultra wideband chip that allows you to unlock Pixel phones and some BMW car models.\nIt’s got the same beautiful design with a circular domed display that looks way more elegant than the squircle Versa or Sense smartwatches ever did. On your wrist, it looks like a watch, not a tracker dressed up as one. The display is a bit fragile for our taste, but as of 2023, you can get a Preferred Care extended warranty in the US and Canada. This is one reason we recommend the Pixel Watch 3 over the original, since at least you have a more affordable fallback should something happen to your display. Google also announced an option where you can skip customer support and mail in broken, out-of-warranty Pixel Watch devices for discounted replacements.\nAs for fitness features, the Pixel Watch 3 is much better for runners than it used to be. It includes a new running dashboard, advanced form analytics, custom running workouts, and even AI-generated workout suggestions. It’s also introduced a new metric called Cardio Load, which measures the intensity of your workouts and suggests a target based on your fitness goals. It’s conceptually similar to Garmin’s Training Load. The Daily Readiness Score has also been revamped and is no longer locked behind the Fitbit Premium paywall. On the health front, users now have Loss of Pulse. If the watch detects you’ve lost your pulse, it’ll call emergency services on your behalf. \nAdditionally, Google has strengthened the watch’s integrations with its own services as well as other Pixel devices. For instance, you have offline Google Maps and a Google Home Tile. You can view your Nest Doorbell camera feed or control your Google TV from your wrist, and there’s also the option to record audio with the Recorder app and transfer it to your phone. With Call Assist, you can use your watch to tell anyone calling you need an extra second to pick up the phone.\nBecause it’s 2025, Pixel 3 owners can also now take advantage of Google Gemini, which began rolling out to watches running Wear OS 4 with Google Assistant in July. The AI assistant can recommend restaurants, add calendar events, create playlists, summarize emails, and handle other complex queries. It’s not always perfect, but it’s generally helpful.\nIf all you want is a fitness tracker that looks like a smartwatch, you can consider the $149.95 ($50 off) Versa 4 since it’s the more budget-friendly option. But there’s no real point in the Sense 2 since the Pixel Watch 3 can do all the same things — and more.\nRead my full Pixel Watch 3 review.\nBest budget Fitbit\nFitbit Inspire 3\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood entry-level fitness & sleep tracker\nBright OLED display\nLightweight\n\n\nHuge bezels\nLimited features compared to cheaper Amazfit Band 7\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.95 $79.95 at Amazon\n $99.95 $79.95 at Best Buy\n $99.95 $79.95 at Google\n\nThe Inspire line hasn’t always felt, well, inspired. But the $99.95 Inspire 3 is different. With a color OLED display, it’s reminiscent of the Fitbit Luxe of 2021, only with a matte black plastic case instead of a metal one. It’s a great throwback to classic Fitbits for people who only want the basics.\nThe Inspire 3 doesn’t overcomplicate things. It’s a fitness band. You won’t get built-in GPS, contactless payments, or digital assistants. Still, what it lacks in smarts it makes up for with Fitbit’s advanced sleep tracking, stress management features, and irregular heart rate notifications. The OLED display is also a step up from the Inspire 2’s monochrome screen, and you still get 10 days of battery life. (Though it’s more like two to three if you enable the always-on display.) \nThe Inspire 3 has a variety of accessories, including a clip attachment if you want to track steps discreetly. There’s even a gold or silver mesh strap if you want to dress it up a bit. \nTo be honest, the Inspire 3 and the Luxe are quite similar; however, the latter has become increasingly difficult to find in recent months, as it’s no longer listed on the Google Store or any other US retailer. That said, opting for the Luxe will net you a nicer case at the expense of five days of battery life, assuming you can find it.\nRead our coverage of the Fitbit Inspire 3 here.\nBest Fitbit fitness tracker\nFitbit Charge 6\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSolid fitness and health tracking feature set\nIt’s $20 cheaper!\nAdds more apps\nCan broadcast HR to fitness equipment\nThe haptic button is better than the groove\n\nYouTube Music is the only option and that’s $11 monthly\nThe Fitbit-Google transition is a lil bumpy\nIt’s not a physical side button\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159.95 $119.95 at Amazon\n $159.95 $119.95 at Best Buy\n $159.95 $119.95 at Google\n\nThe Charge series has always been popular, and the $159.95 Charge 6 is no exception. It’s Fitbit’s higher-end fitness band but easily competes with the more expensive Versa 4 on features. It features a color OLED screen plus an EKG and EDA sensor. You also get built-in GPS, NFC payments, and SpO2 sensors — the only thing you’re really missing is a digital assistant.\nThe only qualm we have with the Charge 6 is the always-on display. While it’s beautiful, it’s a major battery drain. The Charge 6 has an estimated seven days of battery life, but that dwindles down to about two if you have the always-on display enabled. This is the same issue that we had with the Charge 5, but it’s fairly typical for Fitbit trackers these days.\nAltogether, though, you’re getting a hell of a lot for the price. It’s the only FDA-cleared EKG wearable you can find for under $200, and the only other Fitbits capable of EKG and EDA readings are the Sense, Sense 2, and the Pixel Watch 3. So unless you’re dead set on the smartwatch form factor, the Charge 6 is the better overall deal. \nCompared to its predecessor, the Charge 6 also adds an improved heart rate algorithm, Bluetooth compatibility with some gym equipment, and a few apps — namely Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music. While YouTube Music works well, I’m not stoked that it requires an additional $10.99 monthly subscription. That said, it’s better than nothing, as Fitbit discontinued onboard music a while back.\nIn terms of hardware, the Charge 6 also features a haptic button instead of an inductive groove. It’s not a physical button, which is a little disappointing, but it’s more reliable thus far than the inductive groove, so I would count this as a net positive.\nYou could technically get the Charge 5 at a discount. However, I’d only do that if it’s significantly cheaper and price is your main consideration. The haptic button, while not what I wanted, is far better than the inductive groove, and you have more app options. Turn-by-turn navigation is also handy for walks, and it at least offers some form of music playback.\nRead our Fitbit Charge 6 review.\nBest Fitbit for kids\nFitbit Ace LTE\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat build quality for a kids’ watch\nCross platform\nFun games that require physical activity to unlock\nVoice calls and text messaging with preselected contacts\nFamily group chat\n\nYou’ll have to charge it every night\nOnly two color options (but multiple band options)\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.95 $158 at Amazon\n $179.99 $159.99 at Best Buy\n $179.99 $159.99 at Google\n\nThe $179.99 Fitbit Ace LTE isn’t really a traditional fitness tracker, though it does track active minutes. Instead, it’s a smartwatch with a mix of kid-friendly games and activities and thoughtful, family-oriented communication features. It’s a walled garden, but an adorable one.\nInstead of rigorously tracking health stats, the Ace LTE tracks “active minutes,” which fill a cute progress meter called a Noodle that runs around the face of the watch. Active minutes earn time with the Ace LTE’s built-in games that, combined with activities, unlock customizations for your kid’s avatar (called an Eejie) that lives in the watch, as well as its little house. You can also unlock different games and virtual items by connecting different watch straps.\nWith a $10/month subscription, you get real-time location tracking and both voice and text messaging to preselected contacts through the Fitbit Ace app (rather than the standard messaging and phone apps). As of November, that includes other family members with Ace LTE watches, as well as a family group chat between parents and kids.\n\n\nI like that the Ace LTE is built more like a cross-platform smartwatch for adults than other kid watches we’ve used, like the plasticky Garmin Bounce. It uses the same charger as the Pixel Watch 3, and gets about a day’s worth of battery on a charge. My kids enjoy it but aren’t obsessed with it — though they have been known to run laps up and down the hallway to earn more game time. \nGoogle says the Ace LTE is best suited for kids aged 7 to 11, and that sounds right. My oldest is 10 now, and she’s been using an Ace LTE for about a year. Once she hits middle school, I think she’ll be frustrated that she can’t use it to talk to her friends. But for now, it’s great. We recently got one for our 8-year-old, and it’s wild that they can text each other from their watches. It also means my 8-year-old can spam the group chat with emoji, but that’s fine too. \n— Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editor\nRead our hands-on with the Fitbit Ace LTE.\nWhat’s coming next\nGoogle will likely introduce the Pixel Watch 4 at its Pixel event on August 20th. Recent leaks suggest it’ll be able to charge 25 percent faster than the Pixel Watch 3 and do so on its side, which could make the wearable easier to repair. It’s also reportedly thicker than the current model — likely to accommodate a bigger battery — and may be sold in new colors to match the Pixel 10 series. It might even retail for the same price as the Watch 3, meaning it might be worth waiting until Google’s forthcoming event before deciding on which model to buy.\nShould you even buy a Fitbit right now?\nFitbit officially became part of Google in 2021. Nothing changed overnight, but technically, it’s Fitbit by Google now. The Fitbit-to-Google migration started in earnest in the summer of 2023, and new users will be asked to log into Fitbit using their Google accounts. In 2026, this will be mandatory for everyone. In February 2023, Google angered longtime Fitbit users by shuttering longtime social features like Challenges and removing step streaks. (Step streaks have since been added back and expanded to Android.) Meanwhile, the Versa 4 and Sense 2 weren’t as feature-rich at launch compared to their predecessors, leading some to feel that Google purposefully did this to put the spotlight on its Pixel Watch. There have also been multiple major server outages in recent years, with the most recent having taken place in July.\nThere’s some tension here, and the future of Fitbit hardware is murky. Especially given the fact that Google laid off about a thousand employees from its hardware departments spanning Pixel, Fitbit, and Nest. If you’re buying a tracker for the first time and want it to last you a while, it might make more sense to opt for a Garmin or Amazfit tracker. Similarly, if you’re looking to upgrade to an older Versa or Sense smartwatch, you might want to see where the dust settles. However, if you know you want a Fitbit, then go ahead. If you’re not in a rush or are undecided, now is not a bad time to sit back and observe.\nUpdate, August 12th: Adjusted pricing / availability, added new details regarding the Pixel Watch 3, and mentioned Google’s forthcoming Pixel 10 event.

The teaser also shows that the phone will come in the nice gray color that Google has already shown in a similar video for a Pixel 10.\nGoogle’s Pixel 10 Pro Fold video doesn’t include any specs, unfortunately, though the phone is rumored to have an IP68 rating that would make it dustproof. Leaks have also shown the phone in green and gold colors that aren’t in this video.

      "raw": "A foldable phone isn’t for the faint of heart. They’re generally heavier, pricier, and have less capable cameras than a standard slab-style phone. And while they’re far less fragile than when they first debuted, foldables are still susceptible to the kind of damage a regular smartphone can shrug off. You really don’t want any dust getting in that hinge. But if you’re an adventurous sort of gadget lover, then a folding phone is a rewarding investment. \nThere are basically two kinds of foldables at the moment — the kind that fold like books and the ones that fold clamshell style, like your old flip phone. Here’s how I think of it: a book-style foldable is like a phone plus a tablet, and a flip-style foldable is a phone plus a smartwatch. The book foldables provide an outer screen for all your regular phone needs, and then a tablet-like inner screen when you want, well, more screen. Flip phones come with a smaller secondary display on the outer panel that’s useful for checking information quickly. When you need to do regular phone stuff, you unfold it.\nSo while they all fit in one category of folding tech, they’re suited to two very different kinds of people — someone who wants even more phone with their phone and someone who wants to be fully immersed a little less. Whichever category you fit into, you’d be wise to get the manufacturer’s extended warranty with your purchase; fixes can be expensive, and you won’t be able to walk into just any phone repair shop to get them. If you don’t opt for the warranty, you’ll want to be sure you can comfortably afford to replace your phone in the event of a sudden sand-related catastrophe. Death can come swiftly to a folding screen.\nIf I haven’t scared you off by this point, then you’re probably the kind of person who will have a heck of a good time with a foldable. I’ve used every phone under the sun, and folding phones are some of my favorite gadgets. Run four apps at once! Prop it up like a tiny laptop! Hold it like a camcorder when you shoot video! There are tons of possibilities, and the thrill you get when you fold your phone shut never fully wears off.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest book-style foldable\nBest flip-style foldable\nThe most fun foldable\nThe best battery life in a foldable\nOther foldables to consider\nWhat’s coming next\n\nBest book-style foldable\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nRidiculously slim and light for a foldable\nAll-day battery with moderate use\nOuter screen finally feels normal\n\nIt’s $2,000\nDurability still a concern\nCamera bump makes it wobble on a table\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2119.99 $1949.99 at Samsung (512GB)\n $1999.99 at Amazon(256GB)\n $1999.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n\nScreen: 8-inch, 1968p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.5-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 4,400mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the foldable we’ve been waiting for Samsung to create. Unlike the long and narrow form factor of previous Z Fold devices, the Z Fold 7 boasts a more familiar 21:9 aspect ratio, making it feel much less unwieldy to use. At just 8.9mm thick, it’s nearly as slim as standard slab-style devices and doesn’t feel bulky in your pocket. Open it up, and you get a spacious inner display that’s perfect for multitasking, gaming, or simply enjoying more screen real estate. It will even last a day with moderate use, which is relatively good for a folding phone.\nThe Z Fold 7, however, isn’t without its shortcomings. Notably, its starting price of $1,999 is a huge reminder that this is a luxury device, not a practical choice for everyone. The outer display also has a lower resolution than the screen found in the more affordable Galaxy S25 Ultra, and the camera bump is quite large, resulting in a slight wobble when the phone is placed on flat surfaces. That said, the camera system is top-notch, highlighted by a 200-megapixel lens that performs well in low-light scenarios.\nIt was going to take a lot to unseat the Pixel 9 Pro Fold as our favorite book-style foldable, but the Z Fold 7 has done just that. The hardware is stunning, and the reworked proportions make it feel much nicer to use. Still, issues like long-term durability remain a concern, while the $1,999 price tag places it out of reach for most.\nRead our full Galaxy Z Fold 7 review.\nBest flip-style foldable\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSamsung finally adopted the big cover screen\nAll-day battery\nReliable camera\n\nMore susceptible to dust than your average phone\nStill too hard to run full apps on the cover screen\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1099.99 $1049.99 at Samsung (256GB)\n $1099.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $1099.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n\nScreen: 6.9-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 4.1-inch, 948p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Samsung Exynos 2500 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,300mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48\nThe latest Galaxy Z Flip may not be as fun as the newest Razr Ultra, but it does offer a few new tricks. Samsung ditched the old file-folder cover screen in favor of a glorious, 4.1-inch edge-to-edge panel that wraps around the cameras. The extra real estate means you have more room to quickly respond to messages or perform any task that doesn’t require you to open your phone (and risk getting lost in a digital rabbit hole).\nIn addition to the larger cover screen, the Flip 7 offers a couple of other thoughtful updates. It’s thinner than its predecessor and features a bigger 4,300mAh battery, which is a step up from the 4,000mAh battery found in the last-gen Flip 6. The camera system remains unchanged from last year’s model, too, though that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The 50-megapixel main shooter still produces great images, and you get all the versatility the flip form factor has to offer, including the ability to easily take selfies using the rear camera.\nDespite some welcome changes, the Flip 7 carries the same IP48 rating as last year’s model, which means long-term durability against fine dust particles remains a concern. However, Samsung offers a great warranty and repair program, along with seven years of OS and security updates. The Flip 7 isn’t perfect, but it’s the most powerful and polished version yet — just don’t drop it while lounging on the beach.\nRead our full Galaxy Z Flip 7 review.\nThe most fun foldable\nMotorola Razr Ultra (2025)\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nOne of the best-looking phones you can buy\nGreat battery life\nOuter screen is useful in unexpected ways\n\nAI button is wasted real estate \nLong-term durability is still a question mark\nCamera processing is occasionally weird\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1299.99 $1065.99 at Amazon (512GB)\n $1299.99 $1099.99 at Best Buy (512GB)\n $1299.99 $1099.99 at Motorola (512GB)\n\nScreen: 7-inch 1224p OLED 165Hz inner screen; 4-inch 1080p OLED 165Hz outer screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide; 50-megapixel f/2.0 selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 68W wired, 30W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48\nThe Razr Ultra is the newest and most advanced member of Motorola’s foldable lineup. Compared to the Razr Plus, it boasts a higher-resolution inner screen, Qualcomm’s most powerful mobile processor, double the storage space, and an upgraded selfie camera. The device is also one of the best-looking phones you can buy — the gold-bronze chassis and wooden back panel lend the Ultra a real elegance. When every phone tends to look the same — even in the foldable market — the Razr Ultra stands out in a crowd, which only adds to its charm.\nBeyond its appearance, the Ultra is just plain fun to use. The 4-inch outer screen covers almost the entire front of the phone, making it perfect for checking notifications, responding to messages, and taking quick actions such as hailing an Uber. The titanium hinge is also an upgrade over the stainless steel found in the Razr Plus. While the Ultra is enjoyable, it can’t overcome the gripes we’ve had with previous Motorola foldables, like inconsistent camera processing. Meanwhile, Motorola is only promising three OS upgrades and four years of security updates, which is on the shorter side considering the $1,300 retail price.\nRead our full Razr Ultra (2025) review.\nThe best battery life in a foldable\nOppo Find N5\nAt less than 9mm thick when shut, the Oppo Find N5 is a foldable phone that’s thinner than any so far.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nIt’s really, really thin\nExcellent battery life\nThe crease is almost invisible\n\nFoldables are still fragile\nIt’s not launching in the US or Europe\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $2099 at Oppo (512GB)\n\nScreen: 8.12-inch, 2248p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.62-inch, 1140p, 120Hz OLED outer screen size/ Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.9 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 8-megapixel selfie cameras (inner and outer) / Battery: 5,600mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IPX8/IPX9\nLet’s get the bad news out of the way first: if you live in the US or Europe, you can’t buy the Oppo Find N5. That rules out, well, a lot of us. But if you live in China, Singapore, or any of the other Asian countries Oppo included in its so-called “global” release, then you’re in luck: you can pick up one of the world’s thinnest book-style folding phones, and the rest of us are all very jealous of you.\nThe Find N5 isn’t all about thinness, either. Its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is highly capable, the phone is fully water-resistant, and battery life is excellent. It utilizes silicon-carbon battery technology to accommodate a large (by foldable standards) 5,600mAh battery, which easily holds up after a long day of heavy use. What’s even more impressive is that, like the aforementioned Z Fold 7, the Find N5 is still barely thicker than a standard slab-style phone and only slightly heavier. That matters when you’re using the phone via the cover screen for long periods of time or stashing it in the side pocket of your yoga pants. When a foldable is only about as heavy and bulky as a regular phone, using the inner screen feels like getting away with something fantastic — not a benefit you have to make many other sacrifices for. Oppo delivers this in spades, and I just wish more of us could… find it.\nRead our full Oppo Find N5 review.\nOther foldables to consider\nThe OnePlus Open strikes a great balance in its form factor and offers a clever UI for multitasking that has won plenty of fans since it debuted. But the phone lacks wireless charging and full water resistance — it’s only splash-resistant — and OnePlus’ software support policy isn’t as strong as Google’s and Samsung’s. Read our review.\nThe Huawei Mate XT gets an honorable mention for its sheer wow factor alone. The “trifold” phone — as it’s been dubbed — contains three screen segments and two hinges, putting it in a category of its own right now. It’s only available in China and a few other countries that don’t include the US or the UK, and it’s monstrously expensive at €3,499. But it’s cool as heck and may be a sign of things to come from other manufacturers. Read our hands-on impressions.\nThe Motorola Razr Plus 2025 is new to the scene, replacing last year’s model. Although the two devices look identical, there are a few notable changes. The biggest difference is that the Razr Plus 2025 now features a titanium hinge, rather than stainless steel, promising better durability and a less noticeable crease when the device is open. Additionally, the Razr Plus 2025 offers IP48 dust and water resistance, whereas last year’s model featured an IPX8 rating. While we haven’t tested the newest model, it appears to be a solid alternative to the Ultra.\nThe standard Motorola Razr 2025 is a more affordable entry point into the world of foldables, starting at $699. The Razr 2025 offers improved performance, battery life, and durability — the kind of bumps we expect year after year. It boasts a smaller cover screen compared to the Razr Plus and Ultra, but still offers a spacious 6.9-inch internal display. We haven’t tested the Razr 2025 yet, but its relatively budget-friendly price is a good option for jumping into the foldable market.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold is an impressive sophomore effort from Google, offering an ideal form factor that’s a joy to use. When folded, the outer screen matches the dimensions of a regular phone, and the inner screen can get nice and bright outdoors. The whole package is also light enough that it sometimes doesn’t feel like you’re holding a foldable, though it does suffer from a slightly downgraded camera system compared to its slab-style siblings. There’s also no formal dust resistance, so long-term durability remains a concern. Read our review.\nWhat’s coming next\nGoogle has an event scheduled for August 20th, where we’re expecting to learn more about the upcoming Google Pixel 10 series. The company has already given us a glimpse at the standard Pixel 10 ahead of the launch event, but we’re still waiting for information about a new foldable. Rumors suggest Google is gearing up to release the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which could feature an IP68 rating, addressing a common concern about long-term durability in the foldable space.\nUpdate, August 12th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added the Galaxy Z Flip 7 as the best flip-style foldable.

      "raw": "Krafton has fired another shot in its legal battle with former executives of Subnautica 2 studio Unknown Worlds, who filed a lawsuit last month, claiming the South Korean publisher undermined the game’s release to avoid paying them a bonus. In its response, Krafton claims that the three plaintiffs, Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire, had “lost interest in developing Subnautica 2.”\nThe story told by Krafton’s lawyers in the filing is that after selling Unknown Worlds to Krafton for $500 million and promising $250 million more in earnout bonuses, Cleveland and McGuire essentially checked out of working on Subnautica 2 to focus on personal projects. \n“In 2024 and 2025, Cleveland stated that he was ‘no longer working on games but […] working on a couple of films,’” while “McGuire started ‘working on initiatives that fall outside of [the Company’s] main development activities.’” As for Gill, “And Gill, who remained, focused on leveraging his operational control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game.”\nThey allege that without the leadership of Cleveland and McGuire, development on Subnautica 2 suffered to the point that a delay of the game’s early access launch was necessary. \n…as the end of the carnout period drew nearer, the game was still nowhere near its planned scope. Indeed, as late as March of 2025, only two months before the Key Employees claimed the game was ready for the first Early Access (“EA”) release, the development lead for Subnautica 2 at Unknown Worlds noted that the first EA and second EA (planned for December 2025) would only be “about 12% of our intended 1.0 scope” and joked that “at that rate we would be in development for 30 years.”\nWhen the plaintiffs disagreed that Early Access should be delayed, Krafton fired them, sparking the battle playing out now in Delaware Chancery Court.\n \n  Defendant's Answer to Verified Complaint  by  krafton",

Reservoir levels recently have continued to fall as increased water use met lack of rain in Britain. | Photo: Getty Images\t\n\nCan deleting old emails and photos help the UK tackle ongoing drought this year? That’s the hope, according to recommendations for the public included in a press release today from the National Drought Group.\nThere are far bigger steps companies and policymakers can take to conserve water of course, but drought has gotten bad enough for officials to urge the average person to consider how their habits might help or hurt the situation. And the proliferation of data centers is raising concerns about how much water it takes to power servers and keep them cool. \n“Simple, everyday choices – such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails – also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife,” Helen Wakeham, Environment Agency Director of Water, said in the press release.\n\n“Simple, everyday choices – such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails – also really helps the collective effort”\n\n\nThe Environment Agency didn’t immediately respond to an inquiry from The Verge about how much water it thought deleting files might save, nor how much water data centers that store files or train AI use in the UK’s drought-affected areas.\nA small data center has been estimated to use upwards of 25 million liters of water per year if it relies on old-school cooling methods that allow water to evaporate. To be sure, tech companies have worked for years to find ways to minimize their water use by developing new cooling methods. Microsoft, for example, has tried placing a data center at the bottom of the sea and submerging servers in fluorocarbon-based liquid baths. \nGenerating electricity for energy-hungry data centers also uses up more water since fossil fuel power plants and nuclear reactors also need water for cooling and to turn turbines using steam, an issue that transitioning to more renewable energy can help to address. \nAugust ushered in the UK’s fourth heatwave of the summer, exacerbating what was already the driest six months leading to July since 1976. Five regions of the UK have officially declared drought, according to the release, while another six areas are in the midst of “prolonged dry weather.” \nThe National Drought Group says pleas to residents to save water have made a difference. Water demand dropped by 20 percent from a July 11th peak in the Severn Trent area after “water-saving messaging,” according to the release. Plugging leaks is another major concern. Fixing a leaking toilet can prevent 200 to 400 liters of water from being wasted each day, it says.",
