      "raw": "Darth Vader’s lightsaber is about to become someone’s prized possession. It’s up for auction alongside a bunch of other iconic movie props, as spotted earlier by The New York Times. The auction is hosted by the memorabilia company Propstore, and it estimates that Vader’s lightsaber will fetch anywhere from $1 million to $3 million.\nDarth Vader had this weapon in hand in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). As noted by Propstore, it’s made from a 1950s British camera flash bulb attachment, which prop makers modified with plastic grips, electrical wires, and magnification bubbles used in vintage calculators.\nIn an interview with CBS News, Propstore CEO Brian Alinger said the lightsaber came from someone who received it as a gift while visiting the set of Star Wars as a child. Propstore matched the lightsaber to the Star Wars films “based on specific damage to the body.”\nThere’s plenty of other exciting memorabilia up for grabs during the auction, with the whip used by Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) expected to net $250,000 to $500,00, and Keaton’s Batsuit from the original Batman (1989), estimated at $250,000 to $500,000. \nYou’ll also find a Spider-Man suit worn by Tobey Maguire, Wolverine’s claws from Logan (2017), a Neuralyzer used in Men in Black (1997), and Chris Evans’ Captain America shield from Age of Ultron (2015).\nYou can browse the full catalog on Propstore’s website. The auction runs from September 4th to the 6th.",

      "raw": "A shot of the HushJet Purifier Compact snapped at IFA 2025.\t\n\nDyson is launching a new air purifier that’s designed to look — but thankfully, not sound — like a jet engine. The Dyson HushJet Purifier Compact is launching in the US on September 30th for $349.99, featuring a new nozzle design that’s shaped to help the device blast jets of air at high speed, similar to how a concentrator works on a hairdryer. \nThe increase in airflow velocity allows the HushJet Purifier Compact to provide “faster, more powerful purification,” according to Dyson. The nozzle is star-shaped to help reduce noise by dampening the sound waves from the compressor. The HushJet also features a night mode to help prevent it from disturbing your sleep, in which it’ll operate at just 24 dBA, which Dyson says is “roughly equivalent to soft whispers.”\nThe new Electrostatic HEPA filter can capture 99.97 percent of particles that are as small as 0.3 microns, according to Dyson, such as pollen, dust, and pet dander.  Removing these from the air in homes could help to alleviate sniffles and itchy eyes for anyone who suffers from being exposed to such allergens, but its worth noting that tech companies love to play on health-related concerns to sell their products. Dyson says its more energy efficient filter lasts up to five years — five times the filter life of its previous HEPA filter — and is fully sealed to kep everything it sucks in inside.\nThe HushJet Purifier Compact weighs seven pounds, measures 17.7 x 9 x 9 inches, and is suitable for rooms up to 203 square feet. It includes sensors that automatically monitor air quality in real time and adjust performance, but users can also create schedules for it to run at specific times, or connect to Alexa or Google to manage the device using voice controls.\nAlongside the new HushJet, Dyson is also launching its new V16 Piston Animal cordless vacuum. It features a new dual conical cleaner head that adapts to all floor types, automatically speeding up when it senses carpet to give it a more robust clean, and slowing down on delicate hard floors to avoid causing any damage. It’s also designed to pick up “even the longest hair,” according to Dyson, preventing hair from wrapping and tangling around the brush bar before sucking it directly into the bin.\nPricing for the US hasn’t been revealed yet, but we’ll find out more when it launches in the States sometime beginning 2026.",

      "raw": "The flagship Horizon 20 Max projector can pump out 5700 ISO lumens of brightness. | Image: Xgimi\t\n\nThe new Horizon 20 lineup of 4K Google TV projectors from Xgimi targets gamers who want to play day and night on the biggest screen possible. In addition to promising an incredibly bright image from the flagship model, Xgimi is at IFA 2025 saying the entire lineup supports low-latency gaming with an input lag of just 1ms — that’s very responsive for a projector that will likely be able to produce a large image in rooms where you can’t control the ambient lighting. \nThe Horizon 20 lineup — compromised of the base Horizon 20 model, the 20 Pro, and 20 Max — is built around an RGB triple laser architecture. The flagship Horizon 20 Max projector can produce an astounding 5700 ISO lumens of brightness, according to Xgimi, which is “perfect for viewers who want immersive visuals even in daylight or high-ambient light environments.” That puts it just behind Dangbei’s 6200 ISO lumen claim for its S7 Ultra Max projector.  The Horizon 20 Pro model can still produce a very respectable 4200 ISO lumens while the base model drops it down to 3100 ISO lumens, according to Xgimi.\nChinese projector makers have gotten into trouble for misleading customers on brightness in the past, but that was before they started measuring brightness in ISO lumens — a legitimate measurement that often yields a number slightly smaller than tests conducted using the ANSI standard. 5,700 ISO lumens is so high that it’s in the range associated with projectors meant for large spaces that cost well over $10,000. Nevertheless, Xgimi tells me that it’s confident that reviewers and users will see this performance reflected in practice.\n\n\n\n\nXgimi’s projectors also support Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and IMAX Enhanced modes, with the inclusion of optical zoom and lens shifting tech. Lens shift works by physically adjusting the position of the lens relative to the DMD chip, allowing the image to move up, down, left, or right without distorting or scaling it digitally. \nThese projectors support a 240Hz refresh and VRR to match the output of a gaming console or PC. However, that 1ms response is only at 1080/240fps — lag increases to 2.2ms at 1080p/120Hz or 3ms at 4K/60Hz. Xgimi also claims a 10,000:1 contrast ratio when a dynamic black level enhancement mode is turned on. Netflix works out of the box which isn’t guaranteed with all-in-one projectors, and you get 24W of built-in Harman Kardon Speakers for 360-degree sound. \nThe Horizon 20 lineup can be preordered in the UK and US starting on September 5th with shipments expected in October. Retail pricing will range between $1,699 for the base model and $2,999 for the Horizon 20 Max. However, temporary early bird pricing at launch drops that range down to $1,189 to $2,399, and you also get a floor stand and an Assassin’s Creed game code.",

      "raw": "The doors to IFA 2025 at Messe Berlin don’t officially open to the public until tomorrow, but several companies have already announced new gadgets, tech, features, and upgrades as Europe’s largest consumer tech show gets underway.\nThere’s a lot of news to stay on top of, and if you’re struggling to ingest it all, here are some of the best announcements from the show so far including innovative new robovacs, more affordable smart home devices, and even a portable home theater on wheels. You can catch up on all of The Verge’s IFA 2025 coverage right here.\nEufy MarsWalker robovac stairlift\nAnker’s Eufy smart home brand has come up with an alternative to having to buy several robovacs for homes with multiple floors — but it still involves buying another device. The MarsWalker is equipped with tank-like treads and four arms it uses to climb stairs while carrying one of Eufy’s robot vacuums inside. Pricing won’t be known until it launches in early 2026, but the MarsWalker can handle curved or L-shaped staircases and will come with its own self-charging base.\nPhilips Hue’s biggest ever product launch\nPhilips Hue could be the real star of IFA 2025 with the biggest launch in the history of the smart lighting company. It’s introducing its first video doorbell and a completely redesigned Hue Bridge Pro with a faster processor and more memory letting it control 150 lights and 50 accessories and store over 500 custom lighting scenes. The new bridge also enables a new feature called Hue MotionAware that lets the company’s smart lights double as motion sensors. To make the smart home even more accessible, Philips Hue is also introducing a more affordable entry-level Essential line with smart bulbs that start at $25 or as low as $15 each when purchased in multipacks and support for Thread. All new Hue bulbs also support Matter-over-Thread, allowing them to pair directly with Matter ecosystems, including Apple Home, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa, without requiring a Hue Bridge.\nBelkin SoundForm USB-C Wired Earbuds with ANC\nBelkin’s solution to active noise cancellation reducing your headphones’ battery life is to take the battery out of the equation. As the name implies, the new $34.99 SoundForm USB-C Wired Earbuds with ANC aren’t wireless and instead connect to your smartphone or laptop using a 4-foot-long tangle-resistant USB cable that includes an inline remote with a microphone and volume controls.\nBluetti Pioneer Na sodium-ion portable power station\nBluetti is introducing what is claims is the world’s first portable power station featuring a safe and long-lasting sodium-ion battery that can be drained and recharged over 4,000 times while still maintaining upwards of 70 percent of its original capacity. Pricing will be revealed closer to its October 2025 launch but the Pioneer Na will deliver up to 1,500W of power through multiple AC outlets and USB ports and offer better extreme cold weather performance than other portable power stations.\nEcovacs Deebot X11 Omnicyclone fast-charging robovac\nBeing able to autonomously return to a dock for a charge more or less solved the battery-life limitations of robot vacuums, but Ecovacs says its new Deebot X11 Omnicyclone won’t need to spend much time out of commission while it tops off its battery. Using GaN-enabled fast charging the $1,499 robovac can quickly recharge every time it returns to its base station to rinse its mopping pads so it spends more time actually vacuuming and cleaning your floors.\nAnker Prime Power Bank (26k, 300W)\nWith a 26,250mAh capacity battery and up to 3ooW of output Anker’s new Prime Power Bank can simultaneously charge two power-hungry laptops and a smartphone, making it a useful companion for those who find themselves working on the road. It includes a charging base that powers it back up at 150W, but if you’re in a real hurry you can connect it to a pair of 140W USB-C PD 3.1 chargers that boost the input to up to 250W, taking the power bank from zero to 80 percent in just 35 minutes.\nTCL Nxtpaper 5G Junior smartphone\nMaking a smartphone less enjoyable to look at might be the fastest way to curb a child’s smartphone addiction. Launching in Europe later this year for around $250, TCL’s Nxtpaper 5G Junior is a smartphone designed for kids featuring the company’s E Ink-inspired display technology that includes a monochromatic mode. Even if the e-reader appearance doesn’t discourage kids from spending hours on their phones, the Nxtpaper 5G Junior’s display should at least be easier on their eyes.\nAnker Soundcore Work AI voice recorder\nAI unsurprisingly has a big presence at IFA 2025, but Anker is leveraging it as a backup for your brain. Roughly the size of a quarter, the small $99.99 Soundcore Work uses a pair of microphones to record important meetings or conversations for up to 32 hours when paired with its charger. The recordings are accessible through Soundcore’s mobile app and are temporarily sent to the cloud for transcription and summarization by OpenAI’s GPT-4.1. \nAukey MagFusion Ark wireless modular charger\nThe wireless charger on your desk is probably still tethered to a power cable, but with its new MagFusion Ark, Aukey is introducing a bit more freedom. It will be available in multiple configurations, but the largest features a charging base with three Qi2.2 pads and a trio of battery-powered Qi2.2-compatible spheres you can take with you to wirelessly charge your smartphone at up to 25W without needing access to a power outlet.\nAnker Soundcore Nebula X1 Pro party projector\nIt stretches the definition of portable, but Anker has created an all-in-one projector that provides a true surround sound experience by sticking its Nebula X1 into a big rolling box that also includes a 160W subwoofer, a pair of 80W detachable soundbar speakers, and two smaller 40W satellite speakers to place behind you. The Soundcore Nebula X1 Pro weighs almost 73 pounds but even heftier is its price tag which is expected to be around $4,000 to $5,000.",

      "raw": "A federal jury in California has ordered Google to pay $425 million for violating user privacy by collecting the data of millions of people even after they disabled tracking, as reported earlier by Reuters.\nThe decision stems from a class action lawsuit filed in July 2020, which accused Google of unlawfully accessing app activity data on users’ mobile phones from July 2016 to September 2024. The lawsuit alleged that during this period, Google continued to collect user data across third-party apps even if they had the “Web & App Activity” setting turned off. \nThe Web & App Activity setting is supposed to control how Google collects information related to your searches, location, and activity on third-party sites, apps, and devices that partner with Google to show ads. Google says it uses this information to provide you with “more personalized experiences.” \nThe jury found Google liable for two of three claims brought by the class action lawsuit, including invasion of privacy and intrusion upon seclusion. The class, which covers around 98 million users and 174 million devices, originally sought over $31 billion in compensatory damages.\nGoogle plans to appeal the verdict. “This decision misunderstands how our products work,” Google spokesperson José Castañeda said in a statement to The Verge. “Our privacy tools give people control over their data, and when they turn off personalization, we honor that choice.” Google argues that it treats data pseudonymously when users turn off the Web & App Activity setting, and claims that users “knew and consented” to this practice.",

      "raw": "Niko and Noa are AI-powered pets.\t\n\nIt was inevitable that AI would be everywhere at IFA this year, but the smart home is where we’re really seeing action. SwitchBot, known for its quirky and clever home gadgets, launched three new AI-powered products this week: a smart home AI Hub, a colorful E Ink AI Art Frame, and two animated AI pets named Niko and Noa.\nAll-seeing AI\nThe SwitchBot AI Hub is a souped-up version of SwitchBot’s existing smart home hubs, which are designed to connect and control its Bluetooth devices, such as smart shades, locks, and lights. This model adds both on-device and cloud-based AI, working with SwitchBot’s cameras and sensors to capture, process, and interpret what’s happening in your home.\nFor example, SwitchBot says the hub could detect an event like “an elderly person falling” and use that as a trigger for an automation. This “event comprehension” uses a vision language model (VLM), which requires a cloud connection and a subscription.  Meanwhile, the on-device AI can identify faces, pets, vehicles, furniture, and more — helping you keep track of things. The company says you can even ask it things like, “Show me where I left my phone,” and it will pull up relevant footage.\nSpecs-wise, the AI Hub is a big upgrade over the Hub 3, featuring dual-band Wi-Fi, extended Bluetooth, and 32GB of built-in storage (expandable to 1TB). It can manage up to eight 2K cameras, stream locally via RTSP, and display footage on a monitor. The hub can support more than 100 SwitchBot devices and bridges up to 30 products into a Matter ecosystem. It’s powered by a 6T AI chip.\nE-paper meets AI \nSwitchBot is also entering a new category with the AI Art Frame, a colorful E Ink Spectra 6 display that blends home decor with AI creativity. You can upload your own photos or generate artwork using prompts in the SwitchBot app, powered by the company’s locally trained AI model.\nAvailable in 7.3-, 13.3-, and 31.5-inch sizes, the frame fits into standard Ikea frames and runs on battery power, allowing for flexible placement. SwitchBot says it can last up to two years on a single charge.\nCuddly with a side of AI\nAnd finally, SwitchBot is bringing an actual robot to IFA — well, two. \nNoa and Niko are SwitchBot’s new AI pets, part of its Kata friends series. Described as soft-bodied household robots “designed for companionship,” videos of Noa and Niko show them flapping their arms and blinking their glowy blue eyes. They resemble fluffy penguins and, according to SwitchBot, they feature small wheels that allow them to move independently. \nThe company also says that the AI-powered bots can “recognize family members, respond to gestures and emotions, and show feelings such as happiness, sadness, or jealousy,” as well as learn your household routines.\nSwitchBot has not announced pricing or a release date for any of these products. However, given the company’s track record of turning ambitious prototypes — such as its multitasking CES robot — into real products, these gadgets have a high likelihood of making it to market. I’ll be getting hands-on time with all of them at IFA this week.",
