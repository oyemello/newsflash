Well, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Trump Administration is “expected to collect a multibillion-dollar fee” in exchange for negotiating a US takeover of TikTok’s US business.\nThat fee will reportedly come from TikTok’s US investors, including private equity firm Silver Lake and Oracle, with the new group getting half of TikTok, while TikTok China’s parent company ByteDance would still have under 20 percent.\nYesterday, Trump said that “the United States is getting a tremendous fee-plus, I call it a ‘fee-plus,’ just for making the deal.” But Trump says a lot of things that need dissecting, and it was absolutely unclear today whether there’s even a TikTok deal or not.  \nSo to see the WSJ reporting that “people familiar with the matter” think a deal might not only get approved, but also see billions of dollars flow from US companies into the Trump Administration’s coffers, sounds like something to be aware of.  Why would those companies pay Trump’s government billions unless they think they’ll make even more?",

      "raw": "Microsoft is raising the prices of its Xbox Series S / X consoles in the US next month. The Xbox Series X will be priced at $649.99 in the US starting October 3rd, up from its existing $599.99 price. The Xbox Series S will move to $399.99, up from $379.99.\nMicrosoft blames the price hikes on “changes in the macroeconomic environment,” which is a lot of words to say: tariffs. Xbox console pricing outside the US will remain the same. Thankfully, pricing for controllers and headsets will remain in the same in the US. \nThe price rises mean Xbox Series S consoles will increase by $20, Xbox Series X consoles by $50, and the 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition Xbox Series X is increasing by $70 all the way up to $799.99.\nHere’s the full list of price increases in the US:\n\nProductNew US price (RRP)Previous US price (RRP)\nXbox Series S (512GB)$399.99$379.99\nXbox Series S (1TB)$449.99$429.99\nXbox Series X$649.99$599.99\nXbox Series X Digital$599.99$549.99\nXbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition$799.99$729.99\n\n\n\nMicrosoft only just raised the prices of its Xbox products worldwide in May, with price hikes to the Xbox Series S / X consoles, controllers, and headsets. Those previous price increases already bumped the Xbox Series X up by $100, and the Xbox Series S by $80. Coupled with today’s announcement, that means the Xbox Series X has increased in price in the US by $150 and the Series S by $100 in just six months.\nMicrosoft’s Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition originally debuted nearly a year ago at $599.99, and it’s now about to be $799.99 — a $200 increase in just a year. Microsoft’s latest price increases are the second this year, following initial price hikes in 2023.\nMicrosoft also planned to hike the price of some of its first-party Xbox games to $80 this holiday, but then walked back those changes in July.",
