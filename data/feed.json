      "raw": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is ordering seven AI chatbot companies to provide information about how they assess the effects of their virtual companions on kids and teens.\nOpenAI, Meta, its subsidiary Instagram, Snap, xAI, Google parent company Alphabet, and the maker of Character.AI all received orders to share information about how their AI companions make money, how they plan to maintain their user bases, and how they try to mitigate potential harm to users. The inquiry is part of a study, rather than an enforcement action, to learn more about how tech firms evaluate the safety of their AI chatbots. Amid a broader conversation about kids safety on the internet, the risks of AI chatbots have broken out as a particular cause for concern among many parents and policymakers because of the human-like way they can communicate with users.\n“For all their uncanny ability to simulate human cognition, these chatbots are products like any other, and those who make them available have a responsibility to comply with the consumer protection laws,” FTC Commissioner Mark Meador said in a statement. Chair Andrew Ferguson emphasized in a statement the need to “consider the effects chatbots can have on children, while also ensuring that the United States maintains its role as a global leader in this new and exciting industry.” The commission’s three Republicans all voted to approve the study, which requires the companies to respond within 45 days.\nIt comes after high-profile reports about teens who died by suicide after engaging with these technologies. A 16-year-old in California discussed his plans for suicide with ChatGPT, The New York Times reported last month, and the chatbot provided advice that appeared to assist him in his death. Last year, The Times also reported on the suicide death of a 14-year-old in Florida who died after engaging with a virtual companion from Character.AI. \nOutside of the FTC, lawmakers are also looking at new policies to safeguard kids and teens from potentially negative effects of AI companions. California’s state assembly recently passed a bill that would require safety standards for AI chatbots and impose liability on the companies that make them.\nWhile the orders to the seven companies aren’t connected to an enforcement action, the FTC could open such a probe if it finds reason to do so. “If the facts—as developed through subsequent and appropriately targeted law enforcement inquiries, if warranted—indicate that the law has been violated, the Commission should not hesitate to act to protect the most vulnerable among us,” Meador said.",

      "raw": "Elektron has built a cult-like following over the years with its unique and, at times, esoteric take on electronic musical instruments. On paper, Tonverk is a seemingly over-powered sampler that continues that tradition. It’s the rare piece of hardware capable of creating multisampled instruments on its own. It turns a single sample track into a nesting doll of multiple samples. And it’s loaded with an absolutely absurd amount of routing and audio processing features. Tonverk is certainly capable of making traditional electronic music, but it definitely caters to those with a more experimental bent.\nAt its heart is an eight track polyphonic sampler, with three different “machines” to pick from: Single Player, Multi Player, and Subtracks. Single Player is a straightforward one-shot machine that plays back a single sample chromatically across the keyboard. Multi Player combines multiple samples of the same instrument for a more realistic recreation. What’s special here is that the Tonverk can automatically create its own multisampled instruments by sending MIDI notes out to external gear and recording the incoming audio. Unfortunately, it seems like there’s no way to edit those samples in the current firmware, which could be a bit of a drag if there’s any latency or if a recording cuts off early.\n\nThen there are Subtracks, which take Elektron’s convoluted workflow to a whole new level. Here you load up kits of eight samples into a single track. This means that, unlike a traditional sampler where your kick drum and snare might need their own track (without some sort of work around), you can just put all your drums in a single place. The one downside is that you can’t change effects independently. Instead if you add reverb to one sample in a Subtrack, it affects all the samples in that Subtrack.\nThere are some other odd omissions, like the lack of a sample chopping mode, which can be found on its other instruments like the Digitakt. That makes it less than ideal if you’re a hip-hop producer that loves cutting up soul samples. Though, the company’s demo video says there are “initially three fresh machines,” which suggests more are in the works. \nThere are also 17 built-in effects, three effects sends, the ability to route audio through an external effects unit, more LFOs and modulation envelopes that you can keep track of. Of course, there’s also the famed Elektron sequencer with 256 steps, individual pattern length per-track, parameter locks for sequencing sound design features, and Trig conditions for introducing variety and randomness to your creations.\nThat’s all quite a lot, but Elektron isn’t just launching a new instrument with Tonverk, it’s launching a whole new hardware platform. The company isn’t saying anything about what will come next, only that Tonverk is “the first device and certainly not the last.” Unfortunately, for the budget conscious, this isn’t a new affordable platform for the company. Instead at $1,599 the Tonverk is decidedly upmarket. It also appears to already be sold out direct from Elektron, though you can still pre-order it from outlets like Perfect Circuit and B&H.",

      "raw": "It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date. \nYou can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.\nTech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.\nFeatured in this article\nBest overall: Sony WF-1000XM5\nSony’s flagship wireless earbuds offer the company’s best noise cancellation, powerful and lively sound, and a comfortable fit.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $213 at Amazon\n $329.99 $214.99 at Best Buy\n $329.99 $214.99 at Target\n\nBest noise-canceling: Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds\nWith dynamic, rich sound and the best ANC available, the QC Ultra Earbuds are a terrific pick if you want to listen to your music in peace.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 at Amazon\n $299 at Walmart\n $299 at Best Buy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\nWhat’s coming next\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nSony WF-1000XM5\nSony’s flagship wireless earbuds offer the company’s best noise cancellation, powerful and lively sound, and a comfortable fit.

Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.\nSome people found the XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.\nOn Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.\nIt’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.\nRead our full WF-1000XM5 review.\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nNothing Ear (a)\nNothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same stylish, semi-transparent design as the company’s other earbuds — but these come in a snazzy yellow. They combine decent ANC, enjoyable sound, and other features like multipoint for under $100.\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nStandout color and design\nVery compact carrying case\nGreat performer for the price\n\nLimited retail availability\nPlastic case can show scuffs\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99 $89 at Nothing\n $99 $89 at Amazon\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nWhen looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating. \nAnd the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ears, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.\nRead my full Nothing Ear (a) impressions.\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nMost powerful ANC you’ll find in earbuds\nLively, rich sound\nStabilizer fins are easier to apply\n\nImmersive Audio drains battery\nWireless charging requires $49 case\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 at Amazon\n $299 at Walmart\n $299 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nBose’s QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are the most powerful noise-canceling earbuds on the market. Of all our top picks, they do the best job of offering peace and quiet from the cacophony of daily life, putting you in a private bubble with your music playlists or favorite podcasts.\nThe QC Ultra Earbuds are extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II in terms of design, fit, and sound. Audio quality is rich and dynamic, delivering more bass thump than, say, Apple’s AirPods Pro. And by switching to a two-piece ear tip / stabilizer fitting process, Bose’s latest flagship buds should fit a wider range of ears more comfortably. The Ultra also introduce a new Immersive Audio mode, which is Bose’s take on spatial audio.\nThat being said, it’s worth noting that Bose recently announced an updated version of the QC Ultra Earbuds, which, with the help of AI, supposedly offer improved call quality and enhanced adaptive ANC to help curb sudden spikes in noise. They’ll also retail for the same price as the current model and come with a wireless charging case when they launch later this year, preventing you from having to pay extra for what has essentially become a table-stakes feature.\nRead our full QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds review.\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHuzzah! Wireless charging!\nAdds ANC, transparency modes, spatial audio\nSlimmer ear hook, smaller case\nAdds heart rate\nGreat sound\nNo price hike\n\nCase is still a chonker\nHeart rate is not that useful for iOS users\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $199.95 at Amazon\n $249 $199.95 at Walmart\n $249.99 $199.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)\nAfter a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-generation pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.\n\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.\nIf you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions. \nRead our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nApple AirPods Pro (second-gen) with USB-C charging case\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nMuch better noise cancellation\nImproved sound quality and clarity\nUnrivaled hearing health features\n\nUnchanged design\nSound is better but not top tier\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $199 at Amazon\n $249 $199 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nFor those invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the second-gen AirPods Pro bring an appealing mix of top-notch noise cancellation and refined sound compared to the original pair. As always, they also include numerous features (spatial audio, audio sharing, automatic syncing across iCloud devices, etc.) that make them an ideal companion to the company’s other devices. They’re also the only AirPods that come with different sizes of ear tips for a customizable fit — including an extra small option. Note: the introduction of the AirPods Pro 3 during Apple’s iPhone 17 event, that model features one additional size, XXS, totaling five ear tip options. They also bring a host of updates, including better battery life, a built-in heart rate sensor, and improved bass. This new model launches September 19th, and we’re working on a full review, so stay tuned.\nThe AirPods Pro have a compact case that supports wireless charging. Setting them up is as simple as holding the open case near your iPhone. The earbuds are lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. Their force sensor pinch controls are easy to get down, and with the second-gen model, Apple added swipe-based volume controls. The AirPods Pro have traditionally ranked among the best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality, and the second-gen earbuds don’t disappoint. Their ANC is improved over the original model and is now right up there with Sony, and their transparency mode has gained the ability to quickly damper sudden, loud noises that might happen around you.\nWhere the AirPods Pro stand out is with their Apple-only features like head tracking for spatial audio, automatic device switching, extensive Find My support, and so on. The charging case now features a built-in speaker and a U1 chip for pinpoint location tracking, and the latest AirPods Pro have better sound and noise canceling capabilities than the original model. Plus, they retain their deep integration with Apple’s hardware ecosystem.\nLast year, Apple also rolled out an impressive set of hearing health features for the second-gen AirPods Pro. They’re now able to serve as clinical-grade hearing aids for people with mild to moderate hearing loss and protect your hearing in loud environments; you can even take a hearing test to assess your own level of hearing loss.\nRead our original AirPods Pro (second-gen) review.\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are Samsung’s best-sounding wireless earbuds yet. They have a stemmed design similar to the AirPods Pro, but even if their design is a little bland, the Buds 3 Pro make up for it with great call quality, useful voice commands, and more.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $189.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $189.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 $189.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSamsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, I’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.\nThe Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And my favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.\nBut they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but I’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller and lighter design is supremely comfortable\nMore powerful noise cancellation\nCrystal-clear transparency mode\nVery pleasant and detailed sound quality\n\nANC can’t quite match Bose\nGoogle still refuses to add higher-quality Bluetooth codecs, limiting overall fidelity\nGemini Live feels more feeble than futuristic\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229 $225 at Amazon\n $229 at Best Buy\n $229 at Google Store\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nWith the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise.\nGoogle’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.\nGot a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.\nRead our full Pixel Buds Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nBeats Studio Buds Plus\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBetter sound, ANC, and battery life than Studio Buds\nStandout translucent case option\nImproved voice call performance\n\nANC and transparency fall short of second-gen AirPods Pro\nDoesn’t offer all Apple ecosystem tricks\nNo wireless charging or in-ear detection\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.95 $99.95 at Amazon\n $169.95 $99.95 at Walmart\n $169.99 $99.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nBeats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort.\nWhat’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.\nThe drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.\nRead our full Beats Studio Buds Plus review.\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFantastic sound quality\nImproved day-to-day reliability\nAuracast-enabled\n\nToo pricey for some\nNoise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything special\nLong-term durability remains to be seen\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.95 $279.95 at Amazon\n $349.95 $279.95 at B&H Photo\n $349.95 $279.95 at Sennheiser\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nSennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.\nThese earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. Sennheiser has also promised that they’re LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.\nRead our full Momentum True Wireless 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nApple AirPods 4\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nUpgraded sound quality\nVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarity\nDeep Apple ecosystem integration\n\nNo wireless charging\nNo built-in speaker on the case\nNo proper multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129.99 $116 at Amazon\n $129.99 $116 at Walmart\n $129.99 $116 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None\nApple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.\nOn the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.\nOverall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes… there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.\nThe AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so I recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $189.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $189.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 $189.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors.

However, when used with other devices, including older iPhone models, charging rates were limited to 15W and slower. A new version of Apple’s MagSafe Charger is now available, and like the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max, it now fully supports the Qi2.2 standard and can be used to charge other compatible devices (like the Google Pixel 10) at 25W rates, as spotted by MacRumors and 9to5Mac.\nThe new charger, which was first leaked last June through Taiwan’s National Communications Commission’s website, is now available through Apple’s online store with a 1-meter USB-C cable for $39, or a 2-meter cable for $49. \nApple introduced 25W wireless charging with the iPhone 16 ahead of the Qi2.2 specification being officially introduced early this year, which is why the faster rate was only available when using Apple’s own wireless charger. Now that the iPhone 17 lineup is Qi 2.2 compatible (as will most of the iPhone 16 lineup be once iOS 26 is released) the phones can be powered up at 25W rates using any wireless charger that supports Qi2.2. However, if you’re upgrading to the iPhone Air, you’re only going to see a maximum of 20W rates when charging wirelessly.",
