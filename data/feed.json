Software engineers Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle were both dismissed today, after being part of a group of seven protesters that managed to get inside Smith’s office in Building 34 yesterday. \nMicrosoft was forced to temporarily lock down its executive building. The protesters live streamed themselves on Twitch entering Smith’s office, and demanded that the company cut ties with the Israeli government. Microsoft employees Anna Hattle and Riki Fameli were both arrested during the incident, alongside former Microsoft employees Vaniya Agrawal, Hossam Nasr, and Joe Lopez. A former Google employee and another tech worker were also arrested.\nAn unnamed Microsoft spokesperson told GeekWire that the two employees were terminated “following serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct.” Microsoft refused to provide an attributable statement to The Verge.\nHours after the protesters were arrested, Brad Smith then held an emergency press conference in his office. Seated on the edge of his desk, Smith addressed a group of reporters and viewers on a YouTube live stream. Smith said that Microsoft is “committed to ensuring its human rights principles and contractual terms of service are upheld in the Middle East.” He said the company launched an investigation earlier this month after The Guardian reported that Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform was being used for surveillance of Palestinians.\nHattle was previously arrested during protests at Microsoft’s headquarters last week, where Redmond police arrested 20 people after a group took over a plaza at Microsoft’s headquarters to protest against the company’s contracts with Israel. Protestors at Microsoft’s campus set up a “Liberated Zone” encampment, and poured red paint over a Microsoft sign on campus.\nThe latest protests were organized by No Azure for Apartheid, a group of current and former Microsoft workers who are demanding that the company cut its ties with the Israeli government. The group has carried out a variety of protests in recent months, with the latest disruptions escalating to the homes and offices of Microsoft executives.",

      "raw": "On Wednesday, the FDA approved the new round of COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax for use by seniors over the age of 65. But for anyone younger than that, the FDA approval only mentions  people who have “at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.” It also removed one option for children entirely, revoking the Pfizer vaccine’s emergency use authorization for children under 5.\nShortly after the FDA announced the new guidelines, a report from The Washington Post said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ousted its director, Susan Monarez. That was confirmed in a post on X by the Department of Health and Human Services, which is now led by longtime anti-vaccine crusader, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. However, Mark Zaid, who said he is one of the lawyers representing Monarez, responded by posting, “Dr. Monarez has neither resigned nor yet been fired. She will not resign,” and the following statement:\nStatement from Mark S. Zaid & Abbe David Lowell\nCounsel for CDC Director Susan Monarez\nAugust 27, 2025 – 7:03 pm ET\nFirst it was independent advisory committees and career experts. Then it was the dismissal of seasoned scientists. Now, Secretary Kennedy and HHS have set their sights on weaponizing public health for political gain and putting millions of American lives at risk.\nWhen CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted. Dr. Monarez has neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she has been fired, and as a person of integrity and devoted to science, she will not resign.\n The Post says Monarez was “pressed for days” by Kennedy about whether she would support reworking the FDA’s policies. The Post reports that “at least three top CDC officials”  have announced plans to resign, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and Debra Houry, chief medical officer.\nAfter previewing the update in May, the government removed healthy pregnant people and children from its list of people recommended to receive the covid vaccine, which CNN reports has already prevented some people from getting vaccinated.\nIn a tweet, Kennedy claims the actions will “keep vaccines available to people who want them, especially the vulnerable,” however, they could now require millions of Americans to prove they are at risk, putting an additional hurdle in the way of getting vaccinated.\nThe New York Times reports that an upcoming CDC decision could impact availability and access at drugstore sites, as laws in some states require the CDC’s recommendation for pharmacy staff to administer the shots. As we noted last month, Kennedy recently fired 17 people from the federal committee (ACIP) responsible for making vaccine recommendations.",

After all, there’s no guarantee they’ll drop lower in price, even when Black Friday and Cyber Monday roll around.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker deals\nHeadphone and earbuds deals\nSmart home deals\nTV deals\nTablet and e-reader deals\nSmartwatch and fitness tracker deals\nOutdoor deals\nMiscellaneous deals \n\nSpeaker deals\nSonos Roam 2\nLike its predecessor, the Sonos Roam 2 is a compact and travel-friendly Bluetooth speaker that easily syncs up with Sonos’ home audio ecosystem via Wi-Fi.

The beige blob will float and bounce around your screen, while its mouth moves in line with its responses.\nCopilot will automatically appear on supported Samsung TVs, where you’ll find it within the Samsung Tizen OS homescreen, Samsung Daily Plus, and Click to Search. You can access Copilot by using a voice command or selecting it with your remote. From there, hit the mic button on your remote, and you can start speaking to Copilot. \nMicrosoft notes that you can sign into the app for a more “personal” Copilot experience that allows the AI assistant to reference your previous conversations and preferences. Copilot is rolling out now on Samsung’s 2025 TVs, including Micro RGB, Neo QLED, OLED, The Frame Pro, and The Frame models, as well as the M7, M8, and M9 smart monitors.

The employees received emails notifying them that they’d been put on administrative leave on Tuesday night, according to The New York Times, which reviewed copies of the email. FEMA didn’t immediately respond to an inquiry from The Verge to confirm the suspensions or respond to allegations in the letter.\nWith the deadly July 4th flooding in Kerrville, Texas, “FEMA’s mission to provide critical support was obstructed by leadership who not only question the agency’s existence but place uninformed cost-cutting above serving the American people and the communities our oath compels us to serve,” the letter says. \nThis isn’t the first time the Trump administration has cracked down on federal employees who’ve voiced concerns about their agency’s ability to meet its mission. The Environmental Protection Agency placed 144 workers on administrative leave after they penned a letter to EPA administrator Lee Zeldin saying, “EPA under your leadership will not protect communities from hazardous chemicals and unsafe drinking water, but instead will increase risks to public health and safety.”",

      "raw": "The Zelos 450 is currently $121 off. | Image: Brandt Ranj\t\n\nMy desire to make authentic-tasing barbecue at home was always tempered by the intimidation of regularly using a smoker. I’ve tried a couple of smart smokers before, but none were as easy to set up, cook with, and maintain as Brisk It’s Zelos-450. An early Labor Day deal has dropped its price to around $328.99 ($121 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and from Brisk It.\nBrisk It Zelos-450 smart grill\nBrisk It’s Zelos-450 is a beginner-friendly smart electric pellet smoker with Wi-Fi connectivity and an AI assistant that suggests recipes and manages cooking. It features 450 square inches of cooking space and can reach temperatures of up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $449.99 $328.99 at Amazon\n $449.99 $329.99 at Walmart\n $449.99 $329.99 at Brisk It\n\nThe Zelos-450 has 450 square inches of cooking space, and can reach up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, though you’ll mostly be cooking at temperatures well below the maximum when smoking. It burns pellets to create smoke, but is powered by electricity, which means you’ll need to have an accessible outlet to cook with it. \nThe smoker took about an hour (and two people) to fully assemble, including setting up an account in the Brisk It mobile app, and connecting Zelos-450 to my Wi-Fi network. Wi-Fi connectivity allows you to ignite and shut down the smoker or adjust its temperature mid-cook from your smartphone. It also allows you to access Brisk It’s Vera AI, an optional virtual assistant that can create recipes and manage your cooks automatically based on voice and text prompts or a photo. \nI’ve used Vera for inspiration, but mostly stuck to recipes I found in cookbooks or online. Having a smart guide can be helpful, but I’m glad Brisk It isn’t overly pushy about using it. You can ignore most of its smart or connected features entirely by igniting and managing the smoker from its control panel. At minimum I recommend turning on app notifications to get an alert when the smoker has reached your desired temperature.\nI’ve cooked wings, pork butt, ribs, burgers, chicken thighs, and sausage on the Zelos 450, and the results were surprisingly good considering my novice status. Meat was tender, with a lot of smoky flavor, and required very little maintenance. The smoker comes with a meat probe, so I could quickly check the internal temperature of larger cuts from my phone and get an alert when they were done. When cooking smaller items, I relied on a previous-generation Typur InstaProbe Instant Read Meat Thermometer to take readings manually, which worked really well. \nOne of my concerns before trying the smoker was having to maintain its supply of wood pellets, but the Zelos 450 has been pretty conservative about using them, so I haven’t had to top up the supply frequently. Cooking on the Zelos-450 requires time and patience (upwards of 18 hours for brisket). You can cook food a lot more quickly on a grill or in a pan, but the flavor, in my experience, makes smoking them worth the wait. I highly recommend picking up Brisk-It’s Waterproof Smoker Cover.",
