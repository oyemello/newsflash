      "raw": "Disclosure: Penske Media Corporation is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.\nPenske Media Corporation, the publisher of Rolling Stone and The Hollywood Reporter, has become the first major American media company to sue Google over its AI summaries. The company claims that the AI Overviews that often appear at the top of search results leave users with little reason to click through to the source, hurting traffic and illegally benefitting from the work of its reporters. \nWhile Penske Media is the biggest name to take on Google over its AI Overviews, it’s not the first. Online education company Chegg sued Google in February, as did a group of independent publishers in Europe. The News / Media Alliance has also spoken out about the feature, calling it the “definition of theft” and seeking action from the DOJ. \nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda defended the summaries to the Wall Street Journal saying, “with AI Overviews, people find search more helpful and use it more.” But Penske and other publishers say there is little reason to follow the links provided in search results and, as a result, they have seen significant drops in traffic and revenue. Penske claims in the suit that revenue from affiliate links is down by over 1/3 this year, and it attributes that directly to a drop in traffic from Google.\nThe company also claims it’s in a tough situation. It can either block Google from indexing its content, essentially removing itself from all search results, which would further devastate its business. Or, it can continue to provide training material to Google for its AI, “adding fuel to a fire that threatens PMC’s [Penske Media Corporation] entire publishing business,” the complaint states, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nThis is, of course, just the latest battle between AI companies and the creators of the content they harvest. Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster recently sued Perplexity, as did News Corp last year. Meanwhile Microsoft and OpenAI have found themselves in the crosshairs of the New York Times, the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and others. Google might also have a tougher time defending itself now that it’s been forced to admit that “the open web is already in rapid decline,” as it faces multiple antitrust complaints.",

      "raw": "It’s been a few years since Netflix confirmed that Liam Hemsworth would be taking over as Geralt of Rivia in the live-action Witcher series. And while we caught a brief glimpse of him in action last year, the first proper clip from season 4 of the show reveals just how Hemsworth will be inhabiting the role — including his take on Geralt’s signature growling voice.\nIn addition to giving us a better look at Geralt, Netflix also confirmed that The Witcher’s newest season is coming out pretty soon: it will start streaming on October 30th. The show’s end is in sight, as Netflix previously confirmed that it will conclude with season 5. Here’s the official setup for the next season:\nAfter the Continent-altering events of season 3, Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri find themselves separated by a raging war and countless enemies. As their paths diverge, and their goals sharpen, they stumble on unexpected allies eager to join their journeys. And if they can accept these found families, they just might have a chance at reuniting for good…\nThe Witcher originally debuted in 2019 with Henry Cavill as Geralt, and his time on the show wrapped up in disappointing fashion in 2023. But Netflix has been trying hard to turn the franchise into something bigger than a single series, with spinoffs like an animated film and a live-action prequel with Michelle Yeoh. Meanwhile, developer CD Projekt Red has a fourth Witcher game in the works, this time with Ciri in the lead role.",

      "raw": "It’s September, and many among us are dealing with back to school, and anticipating the colder weather that’s on its way (at least, if you live in the northern climes). This, plus a somewhat fraught political atmosphere, means that you might be looking for reliable, affordable ways to escape the doldrums.\nYou don’t need us to tell you that a way to do that is by watching some movies and TV shows. Through September 18th, Paramount is offering a doozy of a deal on both tiers of its Plus streaming service. You can save 50 percent on an annual subscription to Paramount Plus Essential, or its mostly ad-free Premium plan. The Essential Plan is down to $29.99 (from $59.99) and a Premium plan goes to $59.99 (from $119.99). The neat thing is that you can take advantage of this whether you’re a new or a returning subscriber (but be careful to mark your calendar; it will renew after that year at full price).\nParamount Plus Essential (annual subscription)\nEssential gets you ad-supported access to TV shows and movies. You won’t be able to download content, but you get many of the same benefits as Premium.\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 $29.99 at Paramount Plus\n\nParamount Plus Premium (annual subscription)\nThe Premium tier allows for downloads, and content can be viewed without ads (except during live TV). You’ll also get access to Showtime series and CBS.\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $119.99 $59.99 at Paramount\n\nIt’s a tempting deal, whether you go for the ad-supported Essential or the skip-the-ads Premium. The latter also lets you download your shows, which could be very handy when you’re traveling with kids, and from its library of Showtime Originals. Either way, you not only get recent shows like Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the entire Yellowstone catalog, Top Gun: Maverick, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, and Bob Marley: One Love, but animation series like South Park and SpongeBob Squarepants, and live NFL games. Also, it hosts every Mission Impossible movie, aside from the latest one, The Final Reckoning.\nOther deals our readers loved this week\nLego kits are really popular, but the more elaborate types can quickly get pricey. If you just want to brighten up your home and do a quick bit of affordable building, you can get a pair of Lego sunflowers for only $7.99 (normally up to $14.99) at Amazon, Target, and Walmart. If you’d rather spend your entire weekend absorbed in Lego building, you can get the house from the Pixar movie Up for $38.49 (normally $59.99, a savings of $21.50) at Walmart.\nSeveral Verge readers have dug this launch deal on the Baseus VD1 Pro dash cam, which is $109.99 at Amazon (instead of $169.99). The system comes with two components: the front camera has a solar panel that powers its rechargeable battery, allowing it to detect motion and impacts for up to 14 days — without sipping on your car’s battery. It also includes a rear camera that can see what’s happening behind your car.\nThe college football season is well underway, and if you can’t get enough of seeing your favorite team hit the field every week, we suggest getting EA Sports College Football 26 for the PS5 or Xbox Series X. The game was $20 off when we first covered the deal earlier this week, but it has since dropped to almost $30 off at Amazon, at least for the PS5 version. It’s $49.99 for the Xbox version, which is still a nice deal. \nIf your chosen way to escape is to take a refreshing run while listening to your favorite tunes, then you may want to check out the Nothing Ear Open, the company’s first pair of open-style earbuds, which are now on sale at Nothing’s online storefront or Amazon for an all-time low $99 ($50 off) with a Prime membership.\nNot every gamer wants a bulky over-ear headset. Sony’s Inzone Buds are a great, significantly more compact alternative, and they’re cheaper than ever this week. GameStop has them for $143.98 ($86 off), and no other retailers are matching the price. These wireless earbuds offer superb sound quality, effective active noise cancellation, and a USB-C transmitter that works in everything from a PS5 and Switch 2 to a PC.\nFinally, if you’re looking for a new phone and are not into the idea of waiting for an iPhone 17 preorder to arrive, you can find a cute and useful budget foldable for a great price. Motorola’s latest Razr is currently matching its all-time low price of $599.99 ($100 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Motorola’s online storefront, It’s solid, lightweight, and offer an internal OLED display that stretches to 6.9 inches when the phone is open.",
