      "raw": "Nvidia’s GeForce Now is getting a big upgrade next month — and it’s also part of an intriguing new experiment. Nvidia, Discord, and Epic Games have teamed up for an early test of instant game demos for Discord servers, which could theoretically let you immediately try a game without buying it, downloading it, or signing up for an account.\nSound familiar? That’s probably because instantly try-before-you-buy was the original vision for Gaikai, one of the first cloud gaming services, and Google’s Stadia cloud gaming service also tried it many times by letting you demo games in a web browser. Now, Nvidia will be showing off the idea at Gamescom this week by letting people try Fortnite from within Discord. \n“You can simply click a button that says ‘try a game’ and then connect your Epic Games account and immediately jump in and and join the action, and you’ll be playing Fortnite in seconds without any downloads or installs,” says Nvidia product marketing director Andrew Fear.\nThat doesn’t sound completely frictionless if you still need an Epic Games account to play, and it’s not clear if Nvidia, Epic and Discord will offer the demo outside of Gamescom just yet. Nvidia is calling it a “technology announcement” rather than a confirmed feature, one that’ll hopefully see game publishers and developers reach out if they’re interested in potentially adding it to their games.\nAfter Sony bought Gaikai in 2012, it initially suggested it would offer instant try-before-you-buy game demos on the PlayStation 4 too, but that never happened. Years later, Gaikai’s founder told me that publishers didn’t necessarily want it.",

It also makes Ford’s hair look fuller and more realistic, and will be available as an update to the real-time path tracing mode in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.\nThe RTX Hair improvements use new hardware capabilities in RTX 50-series GPUs, as Nvidia added hardware acceleration of ray tracing for hair and fur and support for the linear swept sphere (LSS) primitive.

Nvidia has been gradually improving its new app over the past 18 months since its release, and it’s getting closer to fully migrating all the legacy control panel options.\nThis week’s Nvidia app update will include anisotropic filtering, anti-aliasing, and ambient occlusion options, meaning you won’t have to navigate to Nvidia’s older control panel app to improve classic games. The setup tool for Nvidia Surround will also be part of the Nvidia app now.\nYou also won’t have to configure DLSS override features on a per game basis anymore, as Nvidia is now adding a global option. You can set your DLSS preferences across all override supported games, and Nvidia’s overlay will also show which DLSS settings are active if you toggle this option on.\nNvidia is also bringing its new Smooth Motion feature, which was previously exclusive to RTX 50-series GPUs, to all RTX 40-series owners. It’s a driver-based AI model that enables smoother gameplay for games that don’t support DLSS Frame Generation. Smooth Motion can be applied to games running with DLSS Super Resolution, at native resolution, or even titles with other upscaling technologies. Nvidia says it will typically double “the perceived frame rate.”\nIf you’re a fan of Nvidia’s G-Assist AI assistant, Nvidia is changing the AI model behind the scenes so it will use 40 percent less memory. The smaller footprint won’t affect performance either, as it’s designed to respond even faster to queries.\nThese latest Nvidia app changes will arrive on August 19th for beta users at 9AM PT / 12PM ET, followed by a general release next week.",

      "raw": "It’s been two and a half years since Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service got a big boost in graphics, latency, and refresh rates — this September, Nvidia’s GFN will officially add its latest Blackwell GPUs. You’ll soon be able to rent what’s effectively an RTX 5080 in the cloud, one with a whopping 48GB of memory and DLSS 4, then use that power to stream your own near-maxed-out PC games to your phone, Mac, PC, TV, set-top, or Chromebook for $20 a month.\nThe news comes with some caveats, but a bunch of other upgrades, too, the biggest of which is called “Install-to-Play.” Nvidia is finally bringing back the ability to install games without waiting for Nvidia to formally curate them. Nvidia claims that will double the GeForce Now library in one fell swoop.\nNo, you can’t just install any old PC game you own — but every game that’s opted into Valve’s Steam Cloud Play will immediately be available to install. “Literally the moment we add the feature, you’ll see 2,352 games show up,” Nvidia product marketing director Andrew Fear tells The Verge. After that, he says Install-to-Play will let Nvidia add many more games and demos to GFN on their release dates, just so long as publishers tick that box.\nCurrently, Steam is the only platform compatible with Install-to-Play, but Fear tells me many publishers tend to opt in through Valve’s distribution network, including Ubisoft, Paradox, Nacom, Devolver, TinyBuild and CD Projekt Red.\nOne important caveat is that Install-to-Play games won’t launch instantly like curated titles; you’ll need to download and install them each time, unless you pay Nvidia extra for persistent storage at $3 for $200GB, $5 for 500GB, or $8 for 1TB per month. Installs should be fast, though, since Nvidia’s servers are linked to Valve’s Steam servers at up to 1Gbps. When GFN originally launched with a similar feature, I remember downloading games far faster than I’ve ever done at home.\nAnd Nvidia has a new use for your home bandwidth, too. If you’ve got enough, GFN will also now let you stream at 5K resolution (for both 16:9 monitors and ultrawides) at 120fps, or at up to 360fps at 1080p. \n\nThere’s also a new optional Cinematic Quality Streaming mode you can toggle that Nvidia claims can reduce color bleed and restore detail to dark and blurry areas of a scene as it’s streamed over the net, and you can now stream at up to 100Mbps, up from 75Mbps previously, to help maintain that quality. (It uses HDR10 and SDR10, with YUV 4:4:4 chroma sampling, streamed over AV1 with an added AI video filter and some optimizations for clearer text and HUD elements.)\nPlus, Steam Deck OLED owners will be able to stream at its native 90Hz refresh rate (up from 60Hz), LG is bringing a native GeForce Now app directly to its 4K OLED TVs and 5K OLED monitors — “no Android TV devices, no Chromecast, nothing, run it directly on the television,” says Fear — and Logitech racing wheels with haptic feedback are now supported too.\nHow much more performance will you truly get from an RTX 5080 in the cloud? That’s the real question, and we don’t have a clear answer yet. For one thing, Nvidia isn’t promising you’ll always have an RTX 5080-tier GPU for every game you play. The company’s $20-a-month GFN Ultimate tier will still include RTX 4080-class cards too, at least for the time being.\nFear says there’s no ulterior motive there — it’ll just take time for 5080 performance to roll out “as we add the servers and bring up capacity.” He also rattles off a laundry list of popular games that’ll have 5080 performance right away, including Apex Legends, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Baldur’s Gate 3, Black Myth Wukong, Clair Obscur, Cyberpunk 2077, Doom: The Dark Ages… you get the idea.\nThe other caveat is that while Nvidia claims its new Blackwell Superpods are up to 2.8 times faster at gaming, that’s only if you have DLSS 4 generating three fake frames for every real frame (4x MFG) and being OK with any resulting lag. We weren’t blown away with the uplift from RTX 4080 to RTX 5080 in our review of the physical card, and latency is even more important when you’re streaming over the net.\nThat said, Tom and I have been impressed with GFN’s latency in the past. I’ve parried Expedition 33 foes and Sekiro bosses with it — and in lightweight games, Nvidia’s latency may have gotten even better this gen thanks to partnerships with ISPs like Comcast, T-Mobile and BT for low-latency L4S tech and the new 360fps mode. The company claims the 360fps mode can deliver end-to-end latency of just 30ms in Overwatch 2, a game where you don’t need multi-frame generation (MFG) to get that many frames. \nThat’s more responsive than a home console — assuming you’re close enough and peered well enough to Nvidia’s servers to get 10ms ping, like I do in the San Francisco Bay Area. \nThe good news is, you won’t have to pay an extra cent for the RTX 5080 performance boost either way. GeForce Now Ultimate will remain $19.99 a month for now. “We’re not going to increase our price at all,” says Fear, in a group briefing. When I ask him privately whether Nvidia will increase it later, he can’t say, but claims GFN has only ever increased price when Nvidia saw a big increase in power usage or needed to rebalance currency exchange in some regions. “Nothing’s written in stone, but we’re saying for now no plans to make a price increase.”\nAdditionally, Nvidia is trying an intriguing new experiment that bakes GeForce Now into Discord so gamers can instantly try new games for free right from a Discord server, no GeForce Now login required. Epic Games and Discord are first partner demoing the technology at Gamescom this week. \n“You can simply click a button that says ‘try a game’ and then connect your Epic Games account and immediately jump in and and join the action, and you’ll be playing Fortnite in seconds without any downloads or installs,” says Fear. He tells The Verge that it’s merely a “technology announcement” as of today, but that Nvidia hopes game publishers and developers will reach out if they’re interested in potentially adding it to their games. \nI hope so, as I’ve been in awe of try-before-you-buy cloud gaming ever since Gaikai introduced the idea 15 years ago, but Gaikai’s founder told me years later that publishers didn’t necessarily want it.\nI’m looking forward to trying GeForce Now’s 5080-class servers when they launch in September, alongside the new 90Hz mode for Steam Deck OLED, and I’m curious whether the influx of games will finally make it feel like a true console alternative for me. One of my last big remaining reservations is how many of my Steam games are still missing. \nSpeaking of which, don’t expect to see Sony or Rockstar games like Grand Theft Auto on the service anytime soon. “I have no updates, they have chosen not to be on GFN, and you should go ask them,” Fear tells me.",

      "raw": "Garmins aren’t just multisport behemoths anymore. | Illustration by Will Joel / The Verge\t\n\nFew brands are as synonymous with outdoor sports as Garmin. You’ll find these fitness trackers and smartwatches on dozens of wrists at any 5K, marathon, or Ironman. You’ll also find Garmin devotees among divers, thru-hikers, golfers, kiteboarders — you name it. But these devices aren’t just for athletes. The company’s made significant strides in its lifestyle offerings, so regardless of your fitness level, there’s a Garmin for everyone.\nIf you’re coming from a more traditional smartwatch, Garmin’s core strengths lie in fitness, GPS, adventuring, and durability. These are hardy devices that are meant to withstand the elements and last weeks on a single charge. Several models come with offline maps, advanced navigational features, and more training metrics than any other platform. Garmin devices tend to be on the pricier side, and the company announced in March that it would begin putting its newest features behind a paywall. That’s a bummer given Garmin spent years publicly stating it had no intention of charging its users extra.\nGarmins aren’t too shabby on smarts, either. While more fitness-focused than anything from Apple, Google, or Samsung, there’s enough to get you the basics like notifications and then some. For example, most Garmins have fall detection and safety features, and several Garmins released since 2023 have an FDA-cleared EKG feature. (You’ll need a phone on hand, however, as only one Garmin model has cellular connectivity.) Many Garmin devices also support offline music playback and come with a small third-party app ecosystem.\nThere are a lot of Garmin watches to choose from. No, seriously, there are six major lineups, and each has a multitude of models. But no worries — I test several Garmins every year and can help point you in the right direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Garmin for runners\nThe best Garmin for endurance sports\nThe best Garmin on a budget\nThe best Garmin to replace a Fitbit\nThe best Garmin smartwatch\n\nThe best Garmin for runners\nGarmin Forerunner 265 / 265S\nGarmin’s midrange Forerunner watch adds a new OLED display, a week’s worth of battery life, and dual-frequency GPS for better accuracy.\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nMore intuitive menu navigation\nMultiband GPS\nLong battery life — even with AOD enabled\nAdds helpful training features\nOh, oh, it’s OLED, you know\n\nIt’s $100 more than the 255\nOLED displays don’t cost $100\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $449.99 at Amazon\n $449.99 at Best Buy\n $449.99 at Garmin\n\nSizes: 42mm w/ 18mm straps; 46mm w/ 22mm straps / Weight: 39g (42mm); 47g (46mm) / Battery life: Up to 15 days (42mm); 13 days (46mm) in smartwatch mode / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 8GB\nGarmin has many running watches, and a lot of them are great. But the Forerunner 265 or 265S (if you have petite wrists) strikes an excellent balance between price, feature set, battery life, and a vibrant OLED display.\nThat said, the Forerunner 265 / 265S is a bit of an odd duck. It comes a mere nine months after its predecessor, the Forerunner 255, and is, in many ways, pretty much the same watch. The main difference is the 265 has an OLED display compared to the 255’s memory-in-pixel screen. Usually, that means worse battery life, but in this case, we got about a week on a single charge with the always-on display enabled. Without it, you can get up to 15 days. Given that OLED is easier to read and just, well, looks nicer, that gives the 265 lineup an edge over the 255.\nThe 265 also has dual-frequency GPS (also known as multi-band). The gist is you get much more accurate maps in challenging environments like cities and dense forests because you can access both the L1 and L5 satellite frequencies. And even with dual-frequency GPS enabled, you still don’t lose a whole lot of battery life. I wore it during a half marathon with that and the AOD enabled, and I still had over 80 percent battery by the time I got home. This is also an excellent price, as the majority of multi-band GPS watches cost well over $600.\nMy main complaint is that $450 (outside of a deal, at least), while not bad for Garmin, is still a lot when you consider that’s the same price as smarter smartwatches with great running features. Some runners won’t care. But if you’re on a budget — or you’re new to running and feel iffy about spending that much — then consider the Forerunner 165 series. It starts at $249.99 (add another $50 for onboard music) and does almost everything the 265 series does. The main things you’re missing are dual-frequency GPS and a few more niche sport profiles. But if you’re mostly sticking to running, gym equipment, cycling, swimming, and hiking, you’re covered.\nGarmin Forerunner 165 Music\nThe Garmin Forerunner 165 Music gets you in-depth training metrics but leaves out some of the more advanced features in exchange for a more palatable price.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 at Amazon\n $299.99 at Garmin\n $300 at REI\n\nNeither has all of Garmin’s training features, but it’s got what you’ll need to run anything from a 5K to a full marathon. That includes a Race Predictor, which gives you an estimate of what your best time would be based on your actual training. You can also use PacePro to figure out your pacing strategy for a race. You also get Garmin’s Training Readiness feature to help gauge load and recovery, Garmin Coach plans, and a host of running form metrics. It also supports offline music and safety features like fall detection. The only thing they lack is advanced mapping. (They still have trackback, point-to-point navigation, and real-time breadcrumb trail support, however.)\nOn the other hand, if your budget allows, you could also consider the Forerunner 570 and  Forerunner 970, which were released in June and cost $549.99 and $749.99 respectively. Both models have a built-in speaker and microphone, OLED screen, skin temperature sensors, flashlight, and built-in EKG reader with atrial fibrillation detection. They also give you a daily evening report with suggestions on how much sleep you should get, plus a digest of your upcoming events, workouts, and the weather. You also get access to Garmin Coach, a free multipart workout program, which allows you to upload your course and receive notifications when you’ve hit certain distance benchmarks. \nWhile both smartwatches have a lot in common, they do have some key differences, the main being that the 970 has maps. The Forerunner 570 comes in 42mm and 47mm sizes, and Garmin says its battery lasts up to 10 or 11 days based on which model you pick  (with the always-on display off.) The Forerunner 970 only comes in a 47mm size, and Garmin says it can last up to 15 days per charge. The Forerunner 970 also includes three exclusive metrics: running tolerance, running economy, and speed step loss. \nThese three tools will give you a weekly maximum mileage recommendation (with the option to adjust it up or down), and assess running efficiency. The running economy and step speed loss features require Garmin’s $169.99 HRM 600 heart rate monitor.\nThe Forerunner 570 is a definite step up from the Forerunner 265, but not a big enough leap to recommend it to everyone instead of that model, especially because it doesn’t offer offline maps. The Forerunner 970 may be overkill for all but the most avid runners, but it’s good to see Garmin continually adding new features to the top of its line. \nRead my full Garmin Forerunner 265S review.\nThe best Garmin for endurance sports\nGarmin Epix Pro Sapphire Edition (42mm)\nThe Garmin Epix Pro comes in three sizes, includes a handy flashlight, and has multiband GPS. Plus, it lasts over a week on a single charge.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nNow comes in multiple sizes\nHands-free flashlight is SO handy\nGreat battery life\nMultiband GPS\nUpgraded heart rate sensor\nStarting price hasn’t changed\n\nAOD zaps battery life to three to four days\nLots of incremental changes\nIt’s a Garmin review, so once again, the app\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999.99 $869.94 at Amazon\n $999.99 at Garmin\n $1000 at REI\n\nSizes: 42mm w/ 20mm straps; 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 51mm w/ 26mm straps / Weight: 42mm: 63g stainless steel, 58g titanium; 47mm: 78g stainless steel, 70g titanium; 51mm: 98g stainless steel, 88g titanium / Battery life: 42mm: up to 10 days (4 with AOD); 47mm: up to 16 days (6 with AOD); 51mm: up to 31 days (11 with AOD) / Display type: OLED / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 10ATM / Music storage: Up to 32GB\nThe Epix Pro will get you most fitness features that Garmin has to offer. You have topographical maps, turn-by-turn navigation, and more training metrics than even a seasoned triathlete would know what to do with.\nThe Pro is more size-inclusive than the standard second-gen Epix, which only comes in 47mm. You can get the Pro in that size, too, but it also comes in 42mm and 51mm. This was a major complaint I had with the second-gen Epix, and you love to see companies actually take this sort of thing seriously. The best part is that the Pro models start at the same price as the regular Epix did. You’ll have to pay $100 extra for materials like titanium and sapphire crystal, but that’s also true of the standard Epix.\nGarmin Fenix 8\nThe Garmin Fenix 8 adds smart features like the ability to take calls on the wrist, and an on-board voice assistant. Read our review.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmartens up Garmin’s flagship multisport watch\nExcellent battery and fitness tracking\nOffers MIP and OLED display options\nCondenses the Fenix and Epix lines into one\n\nThe starting price is $350 more than the Fenix 7!\nSmart features are less helpful without LTE\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999.99 at Garmin\n $1000 at REI\n\nThat said, it muddies the waters if you’re trying to pick between the Epix Pro, Fenix 7, Fenix 7 Pro, and now, the Fenix 8. The main difference is the Epix watches all have OLED displays. One reason I prefer OLED is that they’re much easier to read indoors — where most of us spend the majority of our time. The Fenix 7 series’ memory-in-pixel displays (plus solar charging if you opt for it) allow for weeks and weeks of charge, but the smallest Epix Pro can get around 10 days with normal usage. The 47mm and 51mm Pro models can go longer between charges due to bigger batteries, but I felt that the 42mm has enough juice to satisfy most use cases. Garmin also has so many battery-saving modes and options that I highly doubt this will ever be an issue.\nNot helping matters is the fact that the Fenix 8 lets you choose between an OLED or a MIP display. You also get smart features like an onboard voice assistant, the ability to take calls from the wrist, and the Garmin Messenger app. The main problem is the starting price is now $350 more (barring any deals) than the standard Fenix 7 and right about on par with the Epix Pro. My personal feeling is the Fenix 8’s smart features are just okay and that you’re really not missing much by not having them. We also often see discounts on older models, so I would put on my bargain-hunting hat for a discounted Epix Pro or Fenix 7 Pro while inventory is still available.\nBut really, the winning feature of the Epix Pro is the hands-free flashlight. It’s so useful in my day-to-day life, and all you have to do is double-press a button. It’s as bright as your smartphone, comes with a red light option if you want something easier on the eyes, and can act as a strobe in an emergency situation. The Fenix 7 Pro and 8 watches also have a flashlight, so a lot of this is going to come down to personal preference for the display, price, and whether you care about smart features.\nGarmin Fenix 7S Pro\nLike the Garmin Epix Pro, the Fenix 7 Pro line has an updated optical heart rate sensor for improved accuracy. It also has excellent battery life, a slightly brighter MIP display, solar charging, and the option of upgrading to sapphire crystal.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHands-free flashlight\nLong battery life\nMultiband GPS\nUpgraded heart rate monitor\n\nThe improved MIP display is still not the easiest to read in dim lighting\nToo similar to the standard Fenix 7\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $899.99 $789.51 at Amazon\n $899.99 at Best Buy\n $899.99 at Garmin\n\nIf you’re set on the most battery life possible, I recommend the Fenix 7 Pro over the standard 7 for a few reasons. Its MIP display is slightly brighter, all sizes have the flashlight, and, like the Epix Pro, it has an updated sensor array. I also recommend it over the MIP versions of the Fenix 8 because it comes in more sizes, and costs around $300 less. Especially since the Fenix 8’s smart features are a bit half-baked.\nRead my full Epix Pro review.\nThe best Garmin on a budget\nGarmin Vivomove Sport\nGarmin’s entry-level hybrid smartwatch looks like a Swatch at first glance. However, it sports a hidden OLED display that delivers notifications without sacrificing fitness tracking.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAesthetically pleasing and accurate tracking\nGood for smaller wrists\nAffordable price\nThe hidden OLED is cool\n\nThe Garmin app is overly complicated\nBattery life is shorter than other hybrids\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 at Garmin\n $179.99 at Amazon\n\nSizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 19g / Battery life: Up to 5 days / Display type: “Hidden” OLED touchscreen / GPS: Tethered GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A\nWhat I love most about the Vivomove Sport is that it doesn’t look like what most people expect from a Garmin. It’s a hybrid smartwatch, which means it looks like a regular watch but can track fitness and deliver notifications. Garmin’s hybrids are also unique in that they all use an OLED display that stays hidden until you need it.\nThis is best suited for a casually active person who wants style and value in a lightweight package. Think wellness, more so than fitness. It gets you continuous heart rate monitoring and blood oxygen level monitoring, and can even provide abnormal heart rate alerts. You also get access to more in-depth metrics like respiration rate, fitness age, stress, and Body Battery, which is Garmin’s tool for visualizing how well-rested you are. For smart features, you get all the basics, like notifications, alarms, and timers.\nThe Sport isn’t quite as full-featured as some other Garmin watches you’ll find on this list. For instance, you’re giving up built-in GPS in favor of tethered GPS through your phone. There are no contactless payments, nor is there a microphone or speaker for taking calls on the wrist. But this is a budget pick, and you get a lot, considering this is an entry-level gadget that could pass for a Swatch at a glance.\nI don’t love that the battery life is short for a hybrid, at around three to four days. Even so, that’s still much better than what you’ll get on an Apple Watch or Wear OS 4 watch. If you’re willing to spend about $100 more, the $269.99 Vivomove Trend has more chic materials, gets you more screen real estate, and wireless Qi charging. Otherwise, this is a great lifestyle wearable that can serve as a classier alternative to your typical fitness band.\nGarmin Lily 2\nThe Garmin Lily 2 is a simple yet chic hybrid analog smartwatch that delivers basic fitness tracking, notifications, and up to five days of battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $248.98 at Amazon\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n $249.99 at Garmin\n\nIf you prefer something newer to the Sport that’s also stylish, the Garmin Lily 2 is another good option, especially if you’ve got particularly small wrists or prefer something extremely lightweight. The swipe and tap gestures are still a little fiddly to use — which was also the case with the first-gen model — but the fresh design is a fun way to lightly monitor your fitness without bogging yourself down with notifications. Garmin also offers the Lily 2 Active, which adds a physical button, GPS, and support for more sports tracking for a starting price of $299.99.\nRead my full Garmin Vivomove Sport review.\nThe best Garmin to replace a Fitbit\nGarmin Venu Sq 2\nThe Garmin Venu Sq 2 is a great replacement for a Fitbit smartwatch. Not only do they look similar, but the Venu Sq 2 has way more fitness features, long battery life, and no subscription.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBright display\nLong battery life\nTons of training and health features\n\nCluttered app\nProprietary USB-A charger\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $189.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $199 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Garmin\n\nSizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 38g / Battery life: Up to 11 days / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 4GB (for Music Edition)\nIf you were disappointed by the Fitbit Sense 2 and Versa 4, the Venu Sq 2 is the next best thing (and, in some ways, better).\nAt a glance, the Venu Sq 2 could easily be mistaken for an Apple Watch. On the wrist, you’ll notice it’s made of plastic, but it still looks quite chic and extremely lightweight. The screen is bright, easy to read, and looks better than any Versa or Sense ever did.\nThe feature set is also great for the price, with built-in GPS, a ton of watch faces, emergency safety features, and contactless payments. If you pay $50 more for the Music Edition, you’ll also get about 500 songs worth of storage, but we wouldn’t recommend it. This doesn’t have cellular connectivity and, therefore, isn’t truly standalone. You’ll most likely be carrying your phone with you anyway.\nAs for health features, the Venu Sq 2 basically has everything you’d get on a Versa or Sense smartwatch but with Garmin’s treasure trove of metrics as well. That includes heart rate tracking, blood oxygen tracking, intensity minutes (how much moderate exercise you get in a week), stress tracking, hydration tracking, respiratory rate, period tracking, and Garmin’s recovery feature, Body Battery. As far as fitness goes, you also get access to Garmin Coach, which provides free 5K, 10K, and half marathon training plans. You love to see it.\nAnother big leg-up Garmin has over Fitbit? None of these features or metrics are locked behind a paywall, even if Garmin’s AI-powered insights and a few other expanded features will only be available as part of Garmin Connect Plus ($6.99 a month / $69.99 annually).\nRead my full Garmin Venu Sq 2 review.\nThe best Garmin smartwatch\nGarmin Venu 3S\nThe Garmin Venu 3S adds a new heart rate sensor, a wheelchair mode, and much-improved sleep tracking and nap detection. \n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood battery life\nBetter sleep tracking and nap detection\nEKG and AFib features\nCan take calls and use your phone’s voice assistant\nAudio meditation sessions done well\n\nPricey compared to other lifestyle smartwatches\nLimited third-party app ecosystem\nNo LTE capability\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $449.99 at Amazon\n $449.99 at Best Buy\n $449.99 at Walmart\n\nSizes: 41mm w/ 18mm straps; 45mm w/ 22mm straps / Weight: 40g for the 3S; 47g for the 3 / Battery life: Up to 10 days for 3S; 14 days for 3 / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 8GB\nGarmin has shored up the smarts in its watches over the past several years, and the Venu 3 series is the smartest (and most affordable) of the bunch.\nThe Venu 3 series comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Like the Venu 2 Plus, it has a microphone and speaker. You can take calls directly from the wrist and issue commands to your phone’s digital assistant via Bluetooth. It’s not the same as having Siri, Bixby, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant built directly into the watch, but it’s a clever workaround that works well for hands-free control. It also supports safety features like fall detection and live tracking, as well as contactless payments.\nLike other OLED Garmins, the display is both vibrant and easy to read. As for health and fitness, you get a nice mix of basic and more advanced features and metrics. It has Garmin’s latest heart rate sensor, which enables FDA-cleared EKG and AFib detection features. Overall, it leans a bit more on the wellness and health side of things, with intensity minutes, blood oxygen monitoring, sleep tracking, period tracking, abnormal heart rate alerts, and stress tracking. As for training, you still get built-in GPS, VO2 Max, heart rate zones, respiration rate, and downloadable training plans via Garmin Coach.\nNew to the 3 and 3S is a sleep coach that factors in metrics like heart rate variability and recent activity to determine your sleep needs. It also finally adds nap detection, a feature that’s been long overdue for the Garmin platform. The Venu 3 series also adds audio-guided meditation sessions, and you can view how these sessions directly impact your metrics. From an accessibility standpoint, this also adds a wheelchair mode.\nTechnically, the Fenix 8 is slightly smarter in that it adds an on-board voice assistant. However, it is also more than double the price and not what I’d consider a good value for the average athlete. It’s more for people who spend hours upon hours training every week.\nThis is the Garmin for you if you want the platform’s in-depth training without sacrificing the productivity of a smartwatch. The main things it’s lacking are cellular options and a robust third-party app ecosystem. That said, it’s got Spotify, Amazon Music, and Deezer for offline listening. It’s also a good option if you’re fed up with MIP displays and want a smarter Garmin rather than a full-on smartwatch.\nRead my full Garmin Venu 3S review.\nUpdate, August 18th: Adjusted pricing / availability.",

      "raw": "Two years ago we learned, thanks to the FTC, that Microsoft was working on a separate “dedicated” version of Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft Gaming CFO Tim Stuart then hinted, a few months later, that there could be a free version Xbox Cloud Gaming in exchange for ads. Now, Microsoft is hinting at making Xbox Cloud Gaming “more affordable” again.\n Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of Next Generation, has appeared on the company’s official Xbox podcast today, to discuss Xbox Cloud Gaming, Xbox Play Anywhere, and Microsoft’s next-gen chip partnership with AMD. At the moment Xbox Cloud Gaming is only part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, meaning you have to pay $19.99 a month to get access to xCloud.\n“One of the things we see is there’s a lot of players who use Game Pass Ultimate to access the cloud, whether that’s the primary way they play, or an additional way to play on the go,” says Ronald. “I think for us, it really opens up the opportunity to make it much more affordable, and make it more accessible to players. Whether that’s going into new regions, or new ways to actually access the [Xbox] cloud.”\n\nMicrosoft’s hints of a more affordable version of Xbox Cloud Gaming come just hours before Nvidia has some “major” GeForce Now news. Nvidia’s cloud gaming service is far superior to Xbox Cloud Gaming, thanks to PC-powered performance, better bitrates, higher resolution gameplay, and lower latency. Microsoft has even integrated GeForce Now into its own Xbox game pages.\nRonald stops short of announcing a new Xbox Cloud Gaming tier, but it’s clear that’s been Microsoft’s thinking for a few years now. Microsoft started expanding Xbox Cloud Gaming beyond just the Game Pass library last year, with the ability to stream games you own as long as you’re an Ultimate subscriber. \nThere’s an opportunity to bring that Ultimate paywall down, especially for mobile streaming. Microsoft had planned to sell games directly in its Xbox app for Android and allow customers to immediately stream those games directly to their phones and tablets, but a legal battle has put those plans on hold.\nMicrosoft is currently preparing the next generation of Xbox Cloud Gaming, alongside its next-gen Xbox console work. “Together with AMD, we’re designing dedicated silicon and hardware to enable the next generation of gaming experiences,” says Ronald. “We’re investing deeply in the next generation of rendering technologies, such as neural rendering, which will bring a new level of quality to the games that you’re having.”\nThat next generation of Xbox hardware will likely see Xbox and Windows move even closer together, alongside the choice of different stores for Xbox owners. It’s also an opportunity for Microsoft to bring more AI-powered features to the next Xbox. \n“We’re also investing in dedicated silicon to enable the next generation of AI capabilities, that will be transformative in how you actually experience your gameplay,” says Ronald. Microsoft will “start experimenting” with some of these AI-powered features on the upcoming Xbox Ally X device, because it has a dedicated NPU chip just like Microsoft’s Copilot Plus PCs.",

      "raw": "Roblox is updating its policies prohibiting romantic or sexual content to also forbid “content, settings, or behavior that implies sexual activity,” according to a Friday post from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman (emphasis Kaufman’s).\nThe changes follow recent lawsuits against the company, including one from Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill that alleges the platform creates an environment where “child predators thrive.” It claims Roblox has “directly facilitated the widespread sexual exploitation of minors and inflicted severe, lasting harm upon the children of Louisiana.”\nIn response, Roblox said that “any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue.” Roblox has rolled out many safety-focused features in recent months, including an age estimator tool for users to verify they are over 13 so they can chat with “Trusted Connections,” accounts parents can use to remotely manage their kids’ accounts, and blocking kids under 13 from accessing social hangout spaces. “Fix it, or shut it down!” Murrill replied.\nAccording to Kaufman’s post, in the “coming months,” Roblox will restrict all unrated experiences — previously restricted to players who are 13 or older — to just the developer and anyone “actively working on the experience.” If a developer wants to make these experiences public, they will have to fill out a questionnaire to receive a content maturity label.\nRoblox is also rolling out “new technology to detect violative scenes,” which is intended to detect user behavior that violates Roblox’s rules in experiences that are otherwise compliant with its policies, such as inappropriate drawings in an experience with a drawing feature. “If this feature detects a server with a high volume of violative user behavior, the system will automatically take that server down,” Kaufman says.\nSocial hangout spaces depicting private spaces like bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as experiences primarily set in private spaces and in places like virtual bars and clubs, will now only be available to users who are 17 or older and have verified their ID. Developers will have to verify that they are 17 years or older if they want to make an experience for users in that same age group.",
