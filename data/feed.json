      "raw": "Bose will now let you turn the ANC off on its new QuietComfort Ultra headphones, boosting battery life to up to 45 hours. | Image: Bose\t\n\nBose has announced a second-generation version of its QuietComfort Ultra wireless headphones it first introduced nearly two years ago. The name is the same, but the new Ultra finally adds support for listening to lossless audio over a USB-C cable, while still carrying forward the 2.5-millimeter analog headphone jack for those who don’t always want to go wireless.\nAvailable for preorder starting today through Bose’s online store, the second-generation QuietComfort Ultra is priced at $449 – a small price bump over the $429 originals. They’re expected to be available starting on October 2nd, 2025. They’ll launch in four color options, including black, smoke, driftwood sand, midnight violet, and white.\nBattery life has been increased to up to 30 hours with active noise cancelling, with an improved Aware Mode that’s better at automatically boosting the ANC to filter out sudden loud noises like a passing bus. That will drop to up to 23 hours of continuous use with head-tracking Immersive Audio turned on, but Bose will now let you push the Ultra’s battery life to up to 45 hours by completely turning ANC off in the mobile app.\nA new Cinema Mode delivers what Bose describes as a “movie-like experience” by spatializing and balancing background sound effects to create a wider sound stage, making dialogue easier to hear. The company recommends using it for podcasts and audiobooks. The new QuietComfort Ultra also features better bass performance at higher volumes, while background noise generated by the ANC system is reduced in quieter settings and won’t drown out “finer details” in what you’re listening to.\nBose has improved the Ultra’s on-head detection so they’ll automatically power up and connect to a paired device as soon as you put them on. When removed, laying the headphones flat or folding them into their included carrying case will put them into a low-power standby mode that Bose says will keep them powered for months.\nThe QuietComfort Ultra now supports Bluetooth 5.4 and carries forward features like multipoint connectivity and compatibility with the SBC, AAC, and Qualcomm AptX Adaptive codecs. Android users can streamline connectivity with their devices using Google Fast Pair, while Spotify Tap is also supported.",

Industry analysts widely believe that new client is OpenAI, a partnership that has been something of an open secret for months. \nOpenAI will deploy the custom chips internally, rather than sell them to external customers, the report says. The move mirrors the approach of other tech giants like Google and Amazon, which have designed custom chips to cut costs, shore up supply and reduce their dependence on chipmaking giant Nvidia. Tech titans like OpenAI have been pumping billions into bolstering AI infrastructure and securing chips to run their data-hungry AI models.",

Video is recorded at 4K resolution with a choice of wide or telephoto views. The pan-tilt controls provide 360-degree coverage and 270-degree out-of-field motion detection, with the latter enabling it to automatically rotate to capture movement before the subjects enter the camera’s frame, according to Reolink.\nThe dual adjustable floodlights provide up to 3000 lumens of light and can be customized to warm and cool color temperatures, allowing users to choose the setting that works best for their lighting or aesthetic requirements. It also comes with local AI Video Search built in, with 512GB of local storage for recordings, allowing users to quickly locate notable events.\nAs the name suggests, the TrackFlex Floodlight WiFi supports Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, alongside smart home integrations, customizable voice alerts, and a 110dB siren to deter suspicious people away from your property. Pricing hasn’t been announced yet, but the inclusion of local AI search is interesting — most rival products provide similar video search capabilities through the cloud, and charge a subscription to do so.

      "raw": "There are several dummy units of the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro Max (left) and iPhone 17 Air (right) on display at IFA 2025.\t\n\nApple’s launch event for the iPhone 17 lineup is just around the corner, and case makers are already showing off the products they can be paired with on the IFA 2025 showfloor. I walked around two rooms dedicated to the latest mobile phone accessories and they were dominated by cases apparently designed for Apple’s upcoming iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Air launches, with several examples being displayed on dummy units.\nThe iPhone 17 models that the cases were based on were consistent across the floor. The rear camera bars on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max have adopted a Pixel-like design, stretching the square bar on the current iPhone 16 Pro models across to cover the entire upper body. The iPhone 17 Air features a similar look, but is much thinner, with a single camera lens and a slimmer camera bar.\nHere’s a closer look at one of the iPhone 17 Pro Max dummies I got my hands on:\nAnd here’s a look at the iPhone 17 Air. In his preview for Apple’s launch event on Tuesday, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said the Air will be “roughly 5.5 millimeters, making it about a third thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro,” but at the expense of a drop in battery life. It certainly feels very slim and lightweight in my hand compared to my chunky iPhone 14 Pro Max.\nWe’ll get official confirmation of the upcoming iPhone designs next week. But for now, all of the iPhone 17 cases I snapped at IFA give us a pretty good idea of what we can expect.",

      "raw": "Withings announced at IFA 2025 today that it’s revamping the operating system of its ScanWatch 2 smartwatch. Called HealthSense 4, the update adds new algorithms for 35 health metrics as well as predictive AI-powered alerts when a user’s health changes. The ScanWatch 2 also gains two new colors and improved battery life of 35 days — a roughly five-day increase from the original.\nIn its press release, Withings says the updated algorithms improve activity tracking and step counts. Sleep tracking will also include more accurate breakdowns of sleep stages and respiratory rhythms. Withings Plus members also get a new Vitality Indicator, which adds up various metrics like heart rate variability, activity, body temperature, and blood oxygen saturation to estimate energy levels and fatigue.\nAs for the predictive AI features, users will now get notifications ahead of health events like the beginning of a menstrual cycle or when they may be falling ill. This isn’t particularly new for the industry, especially as AI-branded health features are now all the rage. Oura has a similar feature called Symptom Radar, while predictive illness warning features on wearables have been in the works ever since the start of the covid-19 pandemic. It’s mostly notable that Withings is a smaller player in the field that has long positioned itself as a more casual lifestyle smartwatch with science-based features. (Though it’s been frequently delayed in attempts to get FDA clearance for some of its more advanced health features.)\nThe new ScanWatch 2 colors — blue and silver — will be available in the larger 42mm model only. New users will get a one-month free trial of Withings Plus with purchase, which enables access to an AI health assistant, the new Vitality score, and Cardio Check-Up, a feature introduced earlier this year that allows your heart health data to be reviewed by cardiologists. The watches go on sale starting September 5th for $369.95.",
