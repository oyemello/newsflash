Now, even HTC is jumping in on the trend with a new pair of Vive Eagle smart glasses that come with built-in speakers, a 12MP ultrawide camera, and an AI voice assistant.\nThe Vive Eagle glasses are currently only available for purchase in Taiwan, but they seem like a direct rival to Meta’s Ray-Ban and Oakley smart glasses. They come with AI-powered image translation, which lets wearers ask the Vive AI voice assistant to translate what they’re seeing into 13 different languages.\n\nOther features include the ability to record reminders, ask for restaurant recommendations, and take notes (sound familiar?). HTC says its Vive Eagle glasses weigh just 49 grams, around the same as Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses.\nThe Vive Eagle glasses cost around $520 USD and come equipped with Zeiss sun lenses, with options for a red, brown, gray, or black frame. It’s not clear when — or if — HTC plans on bringing these smart glasses to North America or Europe, but Meta might have some competition if it does.",

      "raw": "The update will be available today for Series 9, 10 and Ultra 2 owners in the U.S.\t\n\nBlood oxygen monitoring is returning to the Apple Watch — sort of. Starting today, Apple is rolling out a software update that enables a redesigned version of the feature for the Apple Watch Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2 that circumvents the import ban imposed by the International Trade Commission.\nTo get around the ban, blood oxygen data collected on the Watch will now be measured and calculated on the iPhone that it’s paired to. While users won’t be able to view the data on their wrist, they’ll be able to view it in the iPhone’s Health app under the Respiratory section. Apple’s announcement states that US customs has ruled that the company will be able to import watches with this redesigned feature.\nThis redesign only covers Apple Watches sold after January 17th, 2024, once the ITC import ban took full effect. It doesn’t impact models sold before that date or watches sold outside the US, all of which still have the original blood oxygen feature. You can tell if you have a covered model by checking if the serial number ends with LW/A. To get the redesigned feature, people with Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2 watches will have to update their devices to watchOS 11.6.1 and their iPhones to iOS 18.6.1.\nApple has been in a lengthy legal dispute with Masimo, a medical device maker known for its pulse oximeters. Masimo alleged that Apple had infringed on several of its patents, filing a suit in 2020 accusing the company of stealing trade secrets. Masimo separately filed a case with the ITC in 2021, which culminated in an import ban in December 2023. Apple has also lodged suits against Masimo over its smartwatches, which it claims are Apple Watch clones. It also filed a 916-page appeal of the ITC ban. That appeal is currently ongoing and Masimo’s patents are set to expire in 2028.",

      "raw": "On the surface, Cadillac’s new Elevated Velocity looks like your typical concept car: gull-wing doors; a plush red interior; a retractable steering wheel for fully autonomous driving; and futuristic lighting scheme. But the real attention grabber is the lifted chassis and a new off-roading mode that could hint at a possible new direction for GM’s luxury brand. \nThe concept is a followup to the Opulent Velocity vehicle that was first revealed at the 2024 Quail, A Motorsport Gathering. That vehicle was an all-electric, 2+2 coupe designed to showcase Cadillac’s vision for future luxury performance and autonomous driving. Cadillac is back at this year’s Quail with the Elevated Velocity, which is 2+2 crossover that’s also meant to foreshadow potential future design cues. \nMost compellingly is the concept’s off-road capabilities. The vehicle rides on 24-inch wheels for better off-road navigation. And a new Terra driving mode activates the vehicle’s air suspension for more comfortable driving on uneven surfaces. \n“If you think about track mode for the dirt, Terra Active is that, where it boosts the off-road capability, optimizing the active suspension to create the best performance at high speed for the type of terrain you might be on, like loose surface,” Bryan Nesbitt, Cadillac’s design chief, said in a briefing with reporters. \nWhen asked whether the new concept could signal an off-road extension of Cadillac, Nesbitt didn’t foreclose on the possibility.\n“Is there more opportunity for higher end performance in this type of form factor and this type of use case relative to, let’s say, more dirt performance?” he responded. “Is there demand for that? We think it’s a pretty exciting thing, and that’s what initiated this kind of the study for us.”\nLuxury automakers have been moving more aggressively in the off-road space, with visions of high-performance rock climbing while nestled in a luxurious interior environment. Mercedes-Benz got things started with the G-Wagen, and since then we’ve seen a variety of brands express interest. Audi’s Q6 E-tron lifted concept was released earlier this year, as was Genesis’ X Grand Equator concept. And BMW just announced its own plans to release a lineup of luxury off-road vehicles. Of course, Rivian’s outdoor-friendly SUV and truck are certainly priced comparable to many luxury offerings. \nThe Elevated Velocity aims to channel that energy through Cadillac’s V-series. The automaker’s performance brand has been on a bit of a tear lately, releasing V-series versions of the Lyriq and Optiq EVs. The new concept is meant to set the stage for the next evolution of Cadillac’s performance brand. By producing more V-badged vehicles, Cadillac is hoping to pivot away from its past image as an “old man” automotive brand to one that’s more Gen Z friendly. \nTo that end, Cadillac has imbued its concept with a lot of digital wizardry that is unlikely to fly in the real world. That includes a steering with a digital display that presents an animated waterfall of sand as a greeting to the driver. The interior lighting can be switched to infrared as a therapeutic measure to “boost recovery.” (The Cleveland Clinic says that red light therapy is an unproven method for treating wrinkles and other skin problems; Cadillac’s Nesbitt says its about “exploring different types of technology.”)\nIn addition to the infrared therapy, the concept also tracks the driver’s biometric data, offering insight into heart their rate, oxygenation, and stress levels. Maybe those levels are too high – the Elevated Velocity will guide the driver through a breathing exercise to bring them back down to normal levels. \nCadillac envisions you partaking in all this wellness-focuses technology when the vehicle is in autonomous mode. When you’re ready to let the car drive itself, the steering wheel and pedals disappear and you’re left in an airy cabin being bombarded by infrared light and breathing meditation features. Sound relaxing?\nBut if the wellness seems like a gimmick, Cadillac can point to the concept’s off-roading powers as a sign that exciting things are coming in the future.",

GuliKit is positioning both controllers as being ideal for e-sports competitors with high Bluetooth polling rates and reduced latency that the company claims outperforms the controllers included with the PS5 and Xbox.\nBut the ES and ES Pro will potentially appeal even more to non-competitive gamers who are more interested in finding an affordable alternative to the $89.99 Switch 2 Pro Controller without sacrificing much functionality to hit a lower price point.\nThe $25 GuliKit ES features anti-drift Hall effect joysticks (Nintendo’s uses the same problematic joystick technology as the previous version) and triggers, a gyroscope for games that support motion controls, and a 950mAh battery with up to 30 hours of playtime. It supports Windows PCs and Android devices, but like GuliKit’s Elves 2, the ES and ES Pro are both Switch compatible and can be used to wake the Switch 2. That’s a feature that’s still not common amongst third-party Switch 2 controllers.\nThe pricier $30 GuliKit ES Pro carries forward all the same features but adds upgraded and more precise anti-drift tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks with adjustable sensitivity, a D-pad that can be switched between four and eight-direction modes, and the ability to swap between PC and Switch button layouts — with alternate buttons being sold separately.\nThere are a couple of Switch 2 Pro Controller features you won’t find on either of these. The ES and ES Pro can’t be used to scan Amiibo figures, and they don’t have an additional set of buttons on the back. But those seem like small tradeoffs given you’re not only saving over $60 by choosing either of these over Nintendo’s, you’re also getting a controller with better joystick hardware that will potentially last a lot longer.",

Envision says the camera-equipped Ally Solos Glasses can read and translate text, describe surroundings, search the web, and recognize people, objects, and signs, feeding information to the user via open-ear speakers built into the ear stems.\nThe Ally Solos Glasses are available to pre-order today for $399, which Envision says is a “special launch pricing” that’s discounted from $699. The frames come in two sizes — regular or large — and a choice of black, gray, and brown color options. Shipping for pre-orders is expected sometime in October 2025.\nThey’re built on the existing AirGo Vision glasses that Solos launched in December, which provide their own vision recognition features via OpenAI’s GPT-4o AI model. Envision’s version replaces GPT-4o with Envision’s “Ally” AI assistant, which is powered by a combination of foundation AI models, including Meta’s Llama, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Perplexity, according to the Ally website.\nThe AI features work by connecting to the Ally iOS or Android app via Bluetooth. The glasses themselves have a strong IP67 rating for protection from dust and water, and USB-C chargeable ear stems that provide “up to 16 hours of active use” on a single charge, according to the pre-order listing. It takes around 90 minutes to fully charge the ear stems, with 15 minutes of fast-charging providing around three hours of battery life.\n\nAccessibility features are already an established benefit on other smart glasses. Envision has previously released assistive eyewear built on the now-defunct Google Glass hardware, for example, and AI vision interpretation features provided by the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have already been embraced by the low-vision community. It’s unclear how the Ally Solos Glasses’ capabilities will compare to more affordable rivals, given $699 is considerably pricier than the $299 AirGo Vision and Ray-Ban Meta.",

      "raw": "This is an official Pixel 10 image released by Google, though it’s probably the Pro.\t\n\nGoogle is readying its next set of hardware announcements, and has already confirmed that the Pixel 10 series is launching this month. We even know what two of the phones look like, thanks to official teasers from Google.\nBut beyond the few tidbits Google has shared officially, there’s an awful lot more we think we know about the Pixel 10 line thanks to leaks, from which phones are arriving — likely the 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold — to camera changes, US prices, and maybe even some long overdue Qi2 support.\nWhat we know officially\nLet’s start with some stone-cold facts. We know that the Pixel 10 line will be announced at a Made by Google event in New York on August 20th, where the company will show off “the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds, and more.”\nWe also know that one of the phones in the lineup will look like the image above, including that blue-gray finish. Color aside, that phone looks almost identical to the Pixel 9 Pro, right down to the flash and temperature sensor inside the camera bar, confirming that Google isn’t changing its design language.\nYou can also see a little more of it in action in this early ad, which doesn’t miss the excuse to dunk on Apple for its repeated Apple Intelligence delays.\n\nWe’ve had a pretty similar tease for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which mostly shows that the foldable a) comes in the same grayish color as the other model, and b) otherwise looks an awful lot like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\n\nThat’s about all Google has said for certain, but here’s everything else we’re expecting to see at the launch later this month. \nTriple cameras all around\nThe biggest surprise this year appears to be a move to upgrade the base Pixel 10 to a triple rear camera, including a telephoto lens for the first time, bringing it in line with the three Pro models.\nBut before you get too excited, know that there are some downsides. To offset the added cost — and perhaps to give you a reason to consider the upgrade to the Pro — Google will reportedly downgrade the Pixel 10’s other cameras. \nAndroid Authority reports that Google is using smaller sensors for the Pixel 10’s main camera and ultrawide than the Pixel 9 had, meaning the cameras will capture less light. In fact, it will apparently use the same sensors it did on the Pixel 9A. That means that unless Google has made improvements elsewhere, the Pixel 10’s main and ultrawide cameras will be worse than on the 9, but offset by the addition of the telephoto lens. At least the selfie camera should remain unchanged.\nIt also means the triple cameras on the 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL — which will apparently be unchanged from the 9 Pro models — could be superior to the 10 across the board. The 10 Pro Fold camera will be comparable to the 10’s, using the same sensors for its main and telephoto shooters, and similarly specced ones for the selfie and ultrawide. That represents a very slight upgrade to the main camera in the Fold, but the base 10 is the only model getting a real camera overhaul.\nContrasting colors\nGoogle may also be making unexpected decisions about the phones’ colors, going by allegedly official renders leaked by Android Headlines.\nOn the base Pixel 10 that means brighter colors than ever (and confirmation of that triple camera). The site reports that the phone will come in “Obsidian,” Google’s standard black finish, along with a vibrant blue called “Indigo,” a paler shade called “Frost,” and an almost fluorescent green dubbed “Limoncello.”\nBy contrast, the Pro models look muted. The 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL come in the same “Obsidian” black, plus the returning “Porcelain” white, a soft green called “Jade,” and a gray-blue called “Moonstone.” You might recognize that shade from Google’s official image up at the top.\nStranger are the colors for the 10 Pro Fold. Android Headlines reports that it only comes in two variants, but unlike last year those aren’t black and white. Instead, the Fold will apparently only be available in “Moonstone” and “Jade,” making it the rare phone to not launch in black at all.\nFor more confirmation of those colors, another leaked image from the Play Store shows the full Pixel 10 lineup with the three Pro models all in “Moonstone” and the regular 10 in “Indigo.” Leaker Evan Blass has also shared multiple images of all the phones in two separate collections of leaked images on X.\nQi2 charging\nIn July, the Wireless Power Consortium announced Qi2 25W, a faster version of the magnetic wireless charging standard, and promised support from “major Android smartphones.” We think that means the Pixel 10 line.\nGoogle hasn’t supported Qi2 on its previous Pixels, but there are good reasons to think that might be about to change. \nThe first is that Android Authority reported in June that Google is preparing an ecosystem of magnetic Qi2 accessories under the “Pixelsnap” brand, including two chargers and a stand. This has been followed by later leaks of Pixelsnap cases with rings for magnets, and a recent image of a magnetic charging puck shared by Blass.\nThat latter leak is arguably the most important. While it had previously been thought that Google might follow Samsung in certifying its phones Qi2 Ready, meaning they would support Qi2 charging but not contain the magnets, this image shows a charger attaching magnetically to the phone itself, which implies full Qi2 support, magnets and all.\nFor more evidence of that, we have the size of the new handsets. Android Headlines claims to have the official dimensions and weights of all four phones, and each is heavier than the previous generation, and all but the XL are thicker, too.\nThis could just be because the phones will have bigger batteries, which several reports have suggested. But Google could also be making space for the magnets required to enable Qi2 support.\nThe first IP68 foldable\nOne rumor that’s circulated for a while is that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be the first foldable phone to pack an IP68 rating.\nBy comparison, Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Motorola Razr Ultra both have IP48 ratings. That means they’re protected against objects larger than 1mm, but the 10 Pro Fold bumps that up to complete protection against dust and particulates — the highest possible rating for dust protection on the IP scale — while maintaining a high water-resistance rating too.\nSo far, no foldable phone has achieved that level of dust and particle protection, whether sold in the US or otherwise, suggesting that this has involved a pretty impressive feat of engineering on Google’s part to protect the phone’s delicate mechanisms entirely.\nChip upgrades\nBoring, I know — every phone, every year, has a chipset upgrade. But we are expecting more from Google this time around.\nAndroid Authority has repeatedly reported that for the new Tensor G5 chip Google is moving manufacturing from Samsung to TSMC, using the same 3nm N3E process Apple uses for the iPhone 16 Pro’s A18 Pro chip. Together with some tweaks to the core layout, that’s expected to produce a significant boost in processing power, closing the gap between Pixels and the competition.\nAI everywhere\nAndroid Authority reports that Google is developing several new AI imaging features, though some may be for next year’s Pixel 11. “Sketch-to-Image” will be the Pixel version of a feature already seen on Samsung phones, while “Speak-to-Tweak” should be a voice-based photo editing tool. The latter has more recently been reported by Android Headlines, which claims you’ll be able to use voice prompts for simple edits like “changing backgrounds, brightening images, or removing objects.”\nAndroid Headlines reports that a new AI feature called “Camera Coach” will use Gemini to advise you as you’re taking shots, giving advice on adjusting camera angles or lighting to get a better photo before you take it.\nAndroid Authority has also reported that the Pixel 10 will have a new virtual assistant called “Pixel Sense,” once rumored to be called “Pixie.” Pixel Sense will reportedly use information from other Google apps to complete tasks across your phone, make predictive suggestions to help you before you ask, and better learn your tastes from all that data. Impressively, that will all be processed on-device.\nIt sounds like a more powerful version of the multimodal actions Google added to Gemini in January, but going by the name, it sounds like a Pixel exclusive.\nThese AI features should arrive alongside Android updates we’ve known about since Google I/O, like the big Material 3 Expressive redesign and a desktop mode based on Samsung’s DeX.\nFamiliar prices and a late Fold\nIf you’re worried that it sounds like Google hasn’t made many outright hardware upgrades this year, you may be reassured by news that they’re probably not changing their prices either. A leak from Android Headlines includes the alleged US pricing for all four phones, and it’s almost identical to last year’s. \nPer rumors, the Pixel 10 will start at $799 for 128GB of storage, or $899 for 256GB. The 10 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB, rising all the way up to $1,449 for a 1TB option.\nThe two larger phones could be the only models with price changes. The 10 Pro XL may see a price bump from $1,099 to $1,199, but that’s only because Google has scrapped the phone’s 128GB option, starting at 256GB instead — and matching the 9 Pro XL’s pricing at that and higher storage tiers.\nMeanwhile, the 10 Pro Fold may stick with a $1,799 starting price for 256GB of storage, but the leak suggests Google is adding a new 1TB option at $2,149.\nThe Fold may also go on sale separately from the other phones. A report from WinFuture, since echoed by Evan Blass, claims that due to “supply chain problems,” the Fold won’t go on sale until October 9th. The Pixel Watch 4 and Buds 2A will reportedly be late too, while the other three phones could hit stores on August 28th.\nUpdate, August 14th: Added new Google ad revealing the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, a link to a recent leak of Pixelsnap phone cases, and rumors of an IP68 rating for the Fold.",

The slogan “black is beautiful” rang out from civil rights marches in the US and UK during the 1960s and echoed through liberation struggles across the global south. It became a rallying cry against racist beauty standards that had long cast Black skin, facial features and hair as undesirable.\nThese movements urged pride in what had been denigrated for centuries, and their message was not limited to people of African or Caribbean heritage. Calls to embrace natural beauty resonated across Asia and much of the global south, directly challenging the colonial belief that lighter skin conferred greater worth.\nUkraine | Donald Trump told European leaders on Wednesday he would be seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine at his summit with Vladimir Putin on Friday and gave reassurances that he would not make any territorial concessions without Kyiv’s full involvement.\nUK news | David Lammy has referred himself to the environment watchdog after going fishing with JD Vance without the required licence during the US vice-president’s trip to the UK.\nImmigration | At least 20 people have died after a boat capsized off the southern Italian island of Lampedusa, a United Nations agency and local media reported on Wednesday.\nUK politics | Keir Starmer is to formally revive Northern Powerhouse Rail this autumn with an announcement expected before the Labour conference.\nPalestine | The United Nations special rapporteur for the occupied territories has warned that moves to recognise a Palestinian state should not distract member states from stopping mass death and starvation in Gaza.\n Continue reading...",
