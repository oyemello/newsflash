      "raw": "If you want to stay alert while running or biking, the Nothing Ear Open are a worthwhile alternative to classic in-ear cans. That’s because the company’s first pair of open-style earbuds — which are now on sale at Nothing’s online storefront or Amazon for an all-time low $99 ($50 off) with a Prime membership — let you listen to music and podcasts while keeping tabs on traffic, pedestrians, and other potential hazards.\nNothing Ear Open\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $149 $99 at Amazon (with Prime)\n $149 $99 at Nothing\n\nNothing’s water-resistant earbuds use an over-the-ear hook to help them sit firmly in place, allowing them to securely rest just inside your ear instead of directly within the canal like a traditional pair of in-ears. Overall, they deliver solid audio quality thanks to a robust set of EQ options, and while bass performance can’t match that of modern in-ear models, their unique design helps reduce sound leakage. Each bud also comes with a pair of microphones and noise-canceling tech, so your calls come through clearer and less muddled.\nIn terms of battery life, the Ear Open charge via USB-C and deliver up to eight hours of playback, which is relatively good given their larger 14.2-millimeter drivers. They also support multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, allowing you to connect to two devices simultaneously, and offer a “Low Lag Mode” for gaming via Nothing’s companion app. And, if you’re a Nothing Phone owner, you get some nice extras, including ChatGPT integration.\nThree more deals worth a look\nIf you’re looking for an alternative to Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller, the GuliKit ES Pro is on sale at Amazon for an all-time low of $25.49 (about $5 off). You can use the wireless gamepad to wake the Switch 2—  a rare feature for a third-party controller — but it also works with both Windows and Android devices. It features anti-drift TMR joysticks, too, along with adjustable sensitivity settings and a swappable button layout for PC and Switch. Plus, its D-pad can toggle between four and eight-direction modes.\nYou can grab a copy of Assassin’s Creed Shadows for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X for $49.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, which matches its best price to date. Our reviewer Ash Parris isn’t usually into open-world games, but the latest title from Ubisoft won her over with its engaging characters, strong story, and stunning visuals of feudal Japan. This limited edition copy comes with both the game and some minor DLC, specifically extra weapons and gear for one of the game’s main protagonists. Read our review.\nYou can currently buy Epicka’s Universal Travel Adapter at Amazon in multiple colors for $17.99 ($5 off), which is its best price to date. The versatile adapter comes with four plug types, so you can use it in over 200 countries, including the UK, Japan, Italy, and more. It offers four USB-A ports, a single USB-C port, and one AC socket, letting you charge six devices simultaneously.",

The renders, shared with Android Headlines by reliable leaker OnLeaks, show a device with slim bezels and a prominent rear camera bar housing a pair of lenses.\nBased on the renders, the Galaxy S26 Edge may look much different than the Galaxy S25 Edge, which features three vertically-aligned rear cameras on the left side of the device. Instead, the Galaxy S26 Edge renders more closely resemble what appear to be iPhone 17 Pro leaks and dummy models spotted on the IFA 2025 showfloor. The difference is that the iPhone 17 Pro is rumored to come with three cameras on the back, not just two.\nThe Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to take the place of the S26 Plus and may also feature built-in magnets for Qi2 charging, bringing it in line with newer iPhones and the entire Pixel 10 lineup. Additionally, Android Headlines claims that the Galaxy S26 Edge will be even thinner than its predecessor, measuring 5.5mm thick (or 10.8mm with the camera bump), as opposed to 5.8mm with the S25 Edge.\nWe’ll likely have to wait until January to see if Samsung adopts the boxy camera island shown in the renders — but in just a few days, we’ll find out if Apple beats it to the punch.",

      "raw": "Several of the most powerful business leaders in the country gathered around a table last night to fawn over President Donald Trump for his AI policies.\n“You and your policies are really helping a lot,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told the president. AMD CEO Lisa Su praised “the amount of acceleration that we’ve seen just in the few short months that the administration has been in place.” Oracle CEO Safra Catz struck a note of adoration at “the fact that you are our president” and that Trump quickly recognized the importance of AI. “You’ve unleashed American innovation and creativity — all the work you’re doing in basically every cabinet post in addition to what’s coming out of the White House is making it possible for America to win.” \n“Thank you for being such a pro-business and pro-innovation president,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman lauded. “It’s a very refreshing change. We’re very excited to see what you’re doing to make all of our companies and our entire country so successful.” He added that his company would “invest a ton in the United States.”\nThe round of flattery came during the public portion of a dinner Trump hosted at the White House Thursday with CEOs from many of the top tech companies working in AI, which also included those from Apple, Google, and Meta. Trump made a point of asking several of the CEOs how much they’re spending in the US in the next few years, and seemed pleased after they threw out numbers in the hundreds of billions. Earlier on Thursday, First Lady Melania Trump hosted a task force meeting on AI education where many of those companies pledged investments to educate the youth and workforce on how to use the new technology.\n\nEach of the CEOs stand to gain — or lose — from Trump and his policies\n\n\nTech leaders’ presence at the White House has become a relatively commonplace occurrence during this administration. Many of the CEOs who attended Thursday’s dinner also showed up for Trump’s inauguration and donated to his inaugural fund. Zuckerberg had met with Trump in the West Wing shortly before the government’s antitrust trial against his company began. On Thursday, Zuckerberg — whom prior to their recent closeness, Trump has previously threatened to jail — sat right next to the president, who teased Zuckerberg at one point of having the opportunity to launch his own political career with a response to a reporter’s question.\n\nEach of the CEOs stand to gain — or lose — from Trump and his policies. Those include everything from tariffs on semiconductors and other products, permits, access to resources like electricity to power energy-intensive AI, and more. Many of them are already engaged in legal battles with the administration over other parts of their businesses. Trump acknowledged Google’s “very good day” Wednesday when a judge denied Trump’s DOJ the most aggressive antitrust remedies it had asked for in its monopoly search case against the company. “Biden was the one that prosecuted that lawsuit,” Trump said, leaving out that his first administration had brought the complaint, and his second administration litigated the remedies trial. “It’s a long process,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said. “Appreciate that your administration had a constructive dialogue and we were able to get it to some resolution.” One or both sides could still appeal the ruling.\nApple CEO Tim Cook, whose products are largely assembled in China and who seemed to be the rare business leader in Trump’s first term who managed to walk a fine line of staying on his good side, seemed eager to maintain his good will while seated across the table from Trump Thursday. “It’s incredible to be among everyone here, particularly you and the First Lady,” Cook told Trump. “I’ve always enjoyed having dinner and interacting.” He thanked Trump for “setting the tone such that we could make a major investment in the United States” and added that it “says a lot about your focus and your leadership.”\nLater, when a reporter asked about Trump’s plans to tariff semiconductors, Trump reiterated his idea that he’d deploy a “fairly substantial tariff” that could be waived if a company was planning to build in the US. “I’d say Tim Cook would be in pretty good shape,” Trump said.",

      "raw": "After the recent self-induced tumult that Sonos has been through, I can understand why some people are reluctant to spend money on the company’s products. But newly appointed CEO Tom Conrad has shown that he’s determined to get back on track and revitalize Sonos as the leading whole-home audio brand. The contentious mobile app is in a much better place now than it was last year, though some customers still encounter bugs and the frustration of speakers randomly vanishing from their system. It’s not all roses, but the situation is moving in the right direction — and I took Sonos’ decision to cancel its video player as a promising sign of renewed focus. \nI’m not about to sell any of my Sonos gear. For one, the company’s whole-home platform offers conveniences that competitors don’t match — at least not without hassle. Most of the time, I’m streaming from Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music. But if I’m watching a sports game on my TV, I can pipe the audio from my Sonos soundbar to a speaker in a different room to follow the action. Playing something over Bluetooth? With most of the company’s recent speakers, it’s possible to do the same thing and spread that music across your entire Sonos system.\nWhy you should trust my Sonos recommendations\nI’ve covered Sonos extensively for several years at The Verge. This has included reporting on the company’s latest news, reviewing a lengthy list of Sonos products, and bringing attention to the app fiasco, which eventually led to the ouster of former CEO Patrick Spence. Audio and home theater are two of my primary focus areas in product reviews, so I’m well-versed when it comes to determining whether a speaker or soundbar is great — or just another also-ran product.\nI wouldn’t fault anyone for waiting to see where Sonos and its app go from here. But keep in mind that Sonos recently confirmed that it will raise prices on “certain products” later this year as a result of President Trump’s tariffs. Putting the software misstep aside, this company makes some genuinely excellent hardware, so if you don’t want to risk paying more, now might be the time to buy. And if you’re wondering which are the true standouts, I’ve got you covered.\nFeatured in this article\nBest overall: Sonos Five\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $549 at Amazon\n $549 at Sonos\n $549.99 at Best Buy\n\nBest to start with: Sonos Era 100\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $199 at Amazon\n $199 at Best Buy\n $199 at Sonos\n\nThe best Sonos speaker to start with\nSonos Era 100\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nImproved sound (now in stereo)\nBluetooth and line-in support\nPrivacy-conscious microphone controls\n\nNo more Google Assistant\nRejiggered controls have a learning curve\nLine-in requires USB-C dongle\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $199 at Amazon\n $199 at Best Buy\n $199 at Sonos\n\nIf you’re looking for a decent-sounding, compact speaker to put in the kitchen, office, or really anywhere in your home, the Era 100 is your best option. Sonos improved upon this speaker’s predecessors, the Play:1 and Sonos One, by upgrading to stereo drivers for richer, wider audio. Bluetooth playback is now supported, along with line-in audio (with a separate dongle). And the Era 100 also has reworked physical controls, including a volume bar you can slide your finger across and, finally, dedicated track controls. \nThe speaker has an elegant design, and you can use hands-free voice controls to summon Amazon Alexa or Sonos Voice Control to skip tracks or switch to a different playlist. Sonos dropped the Era 100’s price to $199 in April, which is more than fair for what you’re getting. I’d buy now and avoid risking the cost going up again, thanks to tariffs.\nRead our full Sonos Era 100 review.\nThe best overall Sonos speaker\nSonos Five\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nPowerful audio with impressive stereo separation\nCan crank loud without distorting\nRegular 3.5mm line-in: no adapter required\n\nLacks smart speaker functionality\nEasily collects dust\nYou’ll end up wanting two, which gets very expensive\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $549 at Amazon\n $549 at Sonos\n $549.99 at Best Buy\n\nThe Sonos Five isn’t just Sonos’ best-sounding speaker; it’s at the top of the pack compared to all competitors. From an audio quality perspective, it beats the HomePod, Echo Studio, Nest Audio, and other mass market speakers — both those that are smart and not. Can you find better hi-fi bookshelf speakers? Absolutely, but those aren’t natively tied into music services like Sonos gear is. The Five is a hefty unit and takes up a decent amount of desk space. But once you throw some music on, its powerful stereo output is enough to handle any dinner party or weekend get-together. \nThere’s nothing “smart” about the Five. It lacks microphones and voice assistant functionality. But that simplicity is appealing in its own right: you’re getting a damn good speaker that ties into the Sonos platform. The Five also features a 3.5mm aux input, making it a good turntable companion — especially if you spring for a stereo pair. \nThe best portable Sonos speaker\nSonos Move 2\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nImproved stereo sound\nMuch longer battery life\nSupports line-in playback\n\nNo more Google Assistant\nCan’t be used as a speakerphone\nHefty for a portable speaker\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $449 at Amazon\n $449 at Best Buy\n $449 at Sonos\n\nWhen it comes to portable speakers, the Move 2 is in a whole different league than Sonos’ much smaller Roam 2. It’s bigger and heavier, but a built-in handle makes it easier to lug the Move 2 around your home or out to the backyard. There’s no comparison between the two when it comes to audio: the Move 2 smokes the far more compact Roam 2. Like the Era 100, it has a stereo driver arrangement, whereas the Roam mixes everything down to mono and sounds more muffled.\nThe Move’s larger size gives it a clear advantage in terms of bass punch, and aside from playing music wirelessly, you’ve got the option of plugging in other devices over USB-C for line-in audio. I also continue to appreciate that the battery in the Move 2 is user-replaceable, which can’t be said of many Bluetooth speakers. You’ll be able to keep enjoying your investment for long, long into the future. And with a dust / water resistance rating of IP56, it can handle rain and splashes of water without problems; just don’t drop it into a pool.\nI prefer the Move 2 over traditional portable speakers since, at least whenever I’m home, the Sonos lets me play music over Wi-Fi at a higher fidelity than Bluetooth can offer. Plus, the Move 2 also supports Apple AirPlay and Spotify Connect, so it’s easy to just skip the Sonos app altogether if you wish.\nRead our full Sonos Move 2 review.\nThe best Sonos soundbar for home theater enthusiasts\nSonos Arc Ultra\nThe Arc Ultra surpasses the original Arc soundbar with more immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound, much better bass, and the ability to play music over Bluetooth.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nMore immersive sound than original Arc\nBass gains are substantial enough to make this a viable standalone option\nNow supports Bluetooth audio\n\nSonos app remains buggy for some\nPlay:1 and Play:3 no longer supported as surrounds\nStill no DTS:X\nFull surround setup skyrockets the cost\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 $899 at Amazon\n $999 $899 at Best Buy\n $999 $899 at Sonos\n\nIntroduced in late 2024, the Arc Ultra improves on the original Arc with significantly more powerful bass response. That’s largely thanks to the inclusion of Sonos’ newer SoundMotion technology, which manages to get a better low-end wallop from a soundbar that’s not much larger than the model it replaces. This means some buyers can get away with buying the Arc Ultra on its own without adding a subwoofer. \nThe Arc Ultra delivers Dolby Atmos surround sound that’s more convincing and immersive than any other Sonos soundbar to date, and it’s up there with the very best you can find from a single-enclosure speaker. Vocal clarity has also improved substantially thanks to better center channel performance. Another upgrade over the first Arc is the addition of Bluetooth audio support.\nRead our full review of the Sonos Arc Ultra.\nThe best Sonos soundbar for smaller rooms\nSonos Beam (Gen 2)\nThe Beam isn’t as powerful as the Sonos Arc, nor can it match the flagship soundbar’s Dolby Atmos immersion bubble. But you still get room-filling surround sound for less money — and the Beam ties into the Sonos ecosystem for added convenience.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nWider, more expansive sound\nHDMI eARC brings better performance\nSleeker design than first Beam\n\nNo up-facing Atmos speakers\nDoesn’t have automatic Trueplay\nSame acoustic architecture as prior model\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 $399 at Amazon\n $499 $399 at Best Buy\n $499 $399 at Sonos\n\nThere are plenty of scenarios and TV rooms where the Arc Ultra might be too powerful. If you’re in a smaller space or don’t need the absolute best surround sound, the Beam (Gen 2) starts to make more sense. It still has Atmos, but the effect is virtualized since the Beam lacks the Arc Ultra’s upward-firing speakers. Even so, the home theater experience you’ll get from the Beam will blow away any speakers built into a TV. \nRead our full Sonos Beam (Gen 2) review.\nThe best Sonos subwoofer for most people\nSonos Sub Mini\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSleek, unique design\nGood bass presence for its size\nEasy setup process\n\nNot suitable for large living rooms\nStill not cheap\nTrueplay tuning only works on iOS\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $429 $343 at Amazon\n $429 $343 at Best Buy\n $429 $343 at Sonos\n\nIn the same vein, unless you’re hell bent on rumbling your walls, the $429 Sub Mini subwoofer is more than enough for layering some extra oomph and growl onto Hollywood blockbusters and your favorite TV shows. The $799 Sub 4 is Sonos’ flagship subwoofer, but plenty of people have saved hundreds of dollars by pairing the Sub Mini with any of the company’s soundbars — and they’ve been ecstatic with the results. \nAs its name suggests, the Sub Mini is more compact than the Sub 4, which makes it easier to find an inconspicuous spot to place it. Even if you’re the type to do a sub crawl and put it somewhere in plain sight, I’d argue it looks more stylish than the blocky Sub 4. \nRead my full Sonos Sub Mini review.\nThe best budget Sonos speaker\nIkea Symfonisk Bookshelf Speaker (Gen 2)\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAffordable way into Sonos ecosystem\nCan be mounted as a shelf\nSatisfactory sound for the size\nGood option for Sonos surround sound\n\nNo built-in mic for voice assistants\nYou’ll want two for the best audio experience\nNo 3.5mm aux input\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 at Ikea\n\nSonos and Ikea might be winding down their partnership, but that doesn’t mean you should sleep on the existing Symfonisk products before they’re completely phased out. The Symfonisk Bookshelf Speaker (Gen 2), in particular, remains the most affordable gateway into the Sonos ecosystem, even with its recent price hike. Sound-wise, it’s not far off from the old Sonos One / Play:1 and is a very enjoyable speaker. Plus, the lower price tag makes it easier to convince yourself to scoop up two for a stereo pair. These — or the Symfonisk Picture Frame Speaker — make excellent rear surround speakers if you’re on a budget. \nRead our full Ikea Symfonisk Bookshelf Speaker review.\nThe Sonos product worthy of a second chance\nSonos Ace\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nStylish design and excellent comfort\nSound, ANC, and transparency are all good\nTV Audio Swap is convenient, versatile, and suitable for gaming\n\nTV Audio Swap handoff can be glitchy\nHeadphones can’t be grouped with Sonos speakers\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399 $299 at Amazon\n $399 $299 at Best Buy\n $399 $299 at Sonos\n\nBoy oh boy, did Sonos’ wireless headphones come right at the worst possible moment. The company’s app crisis completely sidelined the Ace headphones. Some customers were also disappointed that the Ace can’t play music over Wi-Fi or be grouped with the company’s in-home speakers.\nBut here’s the thing: the Ace headphones are still fantastic. They’re comfortable, have a gorgeous design (with easily swappable ear pads), and sound detailed, powerful, and expressive. They support wired audio over USB-C in addition to Bluetooth. And the TV Audio Swap feature is a useful perk that I still often use late at night when my Arc Ultra would disturb others. You can route any audio that would normally come through the soundbar — from your TV, gaming console, or streaming device — through two pairs of headphones and listen privately (with spatial audio surround sound). Sonos’ new TrueCinema mode even lets you fine-tune the latter to better reflect the acoustics of your space.\nNo, the Ace headphones aren’t what I’d consider the ideal of a wearable product from Sonos. But they remain a wholly impressive debut that fell victim to the company’s poor software decisions. \nRead our full Sonos Ace review.\nPhotography by Chris Welch / The Verge\nUpdate, September 5th: Adjusted pricing and availability.

The company wasn’t yet willing to divulge any technical specs. Still, the new Palma appears to feature a color E Ink screen, and the device’s status bar also shows a 4G+ LTE cellular connection, seemingly indicating the next Palma could also be a fully-functional smartphone.\nThe two previous versions of the Android-powered Boox Palma both feature a 6.13-inch black and white e-paper screen, but Boox was one of the earliest adopters of E Ink’s color screen technology and introduced color e-readers long before Amazon and Kobo.\nBut a color screen isn’t the most requested feature amongst Palma fans. The pocketable e-readers have only offered Wi-Fi connectivity so far. Their functionality has come close to replicating an Android phone, featuring dual microphones and even a camera on the back. But you lose connectivity if you leave the house without a hotspot. \nIt’s not yet known if the next Palma will include a SIM card tray, rely on eSim, or what cellular networks it will be compatible with. But like the Bigme Hibreak Pro that was announced earlier this year, it could be a true smartphone replacement for those wanting a more distraction-free experience (browsing social media on an E Ink screen still isn’t easy on the eyes) or better battery life.",

      "raw": "Elon Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire if Tesla shareholders approve a new pay package that was just put forward by the company’s board. \nMusk would need to meet certain milestones in order to receive that eye-popping compensation, such as producing 1 million robotaxis and 1 million humanoid robots, as well as increase Tesla’s valuation by trillions of dollars. Musk, already the world’s richest man, would ascend to new heights of financial untouchability if he is able to achieve these goals. \nThe proposal builds on an interim award of $29 billion that was announced last month. In total, the package is worth approximately $975 billion based on maximum payout. And it would give Musk more control over the company, which he has demanded in order to achieve his vision for AI-powered cars and robots.\n\nMusk would need to meet certain milestones in order to receive that compensation\n\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Tesla has tried throwing a bunch of cash at Musk to keep him focused on the company. The company offered him a pay package worth more than $50 billion in 2018, but last year a Delaware court voided it, arguing that the deal was flawed and unfair to shareholders and that Musk held undue influence over its composition. Shareholders had voted twice to approve the hefty compensation, but the judge still upheld their ruling that blocked it. Tesla has appealed the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court.\nNow, the company is asking shareholders to approve this new award, arguing that Tesla is on the cusp of becoming a leader in AI and robotics, requiring Musk’s steady hand on the helm.\n“We believe that Elon’s singular vision is vital to navigating this critical inflection point,” Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders. “We also recognize the formidable nature of this undertaking and as a result, the importance of having a leader who is not only willing and capable but eager to meet this challenge.”\nThe pay package amounts to a huge vote of confidence at a time when Musk’s political meddling has taken an enormous toll on the electric car company that is the source for his vast wealth. Tesla’s sales have declined significantly across the globe as rising competition from China, as well as Musk’s vocal support for far-right politics, have diminished the company’s brand. And yet, Tesla’s stock has always outperformed its reality as an electric car and renewable energy company, which has led some critics to deride it as meme stock.\nTo secure this vast payout, Musk would need to stay as CEO of Tesla for at least seven years, or up to 10 years in order to receive the full amount. During that time, he would need to deploy 1 million robotaxis into commercial service, as well as 1 million Optimus robots, all while growing the company’s market capitalization by trillions of dollars and creating “nearly $7.5 trillion in value for shareholders.” Musk and his brother Kimbal, both board members, recused themselves from the proposal, according to the filing.\nAfter years of growth, the sudden reversal in Tesla’s fortune has left many investors and supporters with whiplash. As Musk slid deeper into politics, investors urged him to stay focused on Tesla and its costly — and questionable — project to build more self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The company rolled out its first robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, this summer — although the service fell short of Musk’s earlier predictions. The company’s only new product since 2020, the Cybertruck, has widely been considered a flop. And competition from legacy automakers, especially those in China, has been sapping Tesla’s resources.\nMusk is currently Tesla’s largest shareholder, with a 13 percent stake in the company. But the CEO has said that he wants more control over the company in order to have more sway over its mission — which this plans aims to produce.\n“That is a major concern for me, as I’ve mentioned in the past, and I hope that is addressed at the upcoming shareholders meeting,” Musk said in a recent earnings call, in response to a question about his voting stake. “I think my control of Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”",
