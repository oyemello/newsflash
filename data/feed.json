      "raw": "General Motors is going to be scaling back production of the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq, as well as the Chevy Bolt EV as it expects sales of electric vehicles to slow dramatically. The $7,500 consumer tax credit for purchasing a new EV is set to expire at the end of the month. That credit has been crucial to driving demand for EVs, which are still more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts.\nThe company is pausing production on the Lyriq and Vistiq at its Spring Hill, Tennessee plant in December. It’s also planning to halt manufacturing for a week in November and October, as well as slow production during the first five months of 2026 by temporarily laying off one of its shifts of workers. Similarly, it’s indefinitely delaying the start of a second shift at a plant near Kansas City, which is supposed to begin producing the Chevy Bolt EV later this year. \nWhile EV sales have struggled to meet expectations, they have improved over time. GM even announced that August was its best month on record for EV sales. But in the same press release it was quick to note that it was unsure what the future would hold. “We will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won’t overproduce,” the company’s Senior Vice President and President, North America, Duncan Aldred, wrote.\nBack in May, transportation editor Andrew J. Hawkins said, “the US was already woefully behind China and other developed nations in terms of clean energy investments. And now it’s likely to fall even further behind, perhaps permanently so.” When the largest American automaker is aggressively slashing EV production, even as sales surge, it’s hard to see how the US can catch up.",

That includes bigger movies you probably already know about, like Netflix’s Wake Up Dead Man and Frankenstein, along with hopefully some great new films you maybe weren’t aware of, like the creepy adaptation of the horror game The Exit 8.\nI won’t be able to see everything, of course, but I’ll do my best to bring you the most interesting stuff — and you can keep up with everything right here.\nWake Up Dead Man adds a delightfully dark twist to Knives Out\n\t\t\t\nPark Chan-wook’s No Other Choice is as bleak as it is hilarious\n\t\t\t\nThe Exit 8 movie is even scarier than the game",

      "raw": "Everyone basically agrees: if you want people to transition from polluting gas guzzlers to electric cars, you have to make them more affordable. The luxury EVs, with their big battery packs and fine leather interiors, are all well and good, but if you really want to move the needle on EV adoption, we need more entry-level options. And so far, we’re lacking. \nVolkswagen hears this, and is responding with a new lineup of small and mid-sized electric vehicles aimed squarely at the low end of the market. We’ve already seen the ID.2all  — recently renamed ID. Polo and ID. Polo GTI — and ID.EVERY1 concepts. Now we’re getting a fourth concept, the ID. Cross, which VW says will get a proper reveal next year. The concept’s name invokes the ID.4’s predecessor, the ID.Crozz, from 2017. \nThe ID. Cross introduces a new design language that VW says it “friendlier” and more approachable than its current lineup of EVs. For evidence of this, look no further than the front fascia with its narrow headlights and a slightly curved lightbar that looks like its smiling at you. \n\nThe ID. Cross introduces a new design language that VW says it “friendlier”\n\n\nAn electric counterpart to the popular VW T-Cross, the ID. Cross will be built on the automaker’s MEB Plus platform, which is an improvement over the current MEB that powers the ID.4 crossover SUV, the ID Buzz minivan, and a dozen other vehicles from Audi, Skoda, and others. This next-gen platform will have better batteries, engines, and software, VW promises — which, if you’ve ever encountered a current MEB vehicle’s software, will come as welcome news. \nThe concept’s front-wheel drive motor spits out 155kW of power, which is the equivalent of around 208 horsepower. It has a range of 420km (260 miles) based on the more generous WLTP cycle. And it can hit a top speed of 175 km/h (108 mph). And with a ball coupling, the ID. Cross can haul up to 75 kg (165 lbs), which VW says is enough to transport two e-bikes. \nThis new drive system will be built in Europe; if fact, VW makes no mention at all of the US market. Not surprising, considering the uneven success the automaker’s EVs have had in America. But still disappointing, considering how starved we are for fun, affordable EVs. \nThe ID. Cross will be similar in size to the T-Cross, which is smaller than the already fairly compact ID.4 SUV. The Cross will be 4,161 mm (164 in) long, 1,839 mm (72 in) wide, and 1,588 mm (63 in) tall — with a wheelbase of 2,601 mm (102 in). The concept is perched on 21-inch alloy wheels designed specifically for the ID. Cross. \nThat said, VW is trying to use the smallish size to its best advantage. With five people inside, the ID. Cross will have a storage capacity of 450 liters, plus 25 more liters in the frunk. The addition of a front truck is a nice surprise, considering all of VW’s current EVs have been sorely lacking in extra storage space. \nThe interior includes fabric-covered surfaces on the dash that matches the materials used on the seats. The steering wheel features — gasp! — real buttons to control driver assist functions and more, which is notable because VW got a lot of blowback for its lack of physical controls in its current crop of EVs. The front seats can be folded flat, flush with the rear seats when stowed, to create a completely flat surface that can be used for car camping. \nVW says the production version of the ID. Cross will get a proper reveal next summer, after the launch of the ID. Polo and ID. Polo GTI, based on the ID.2all concept. The ID.EVERY1 — which has yet to get its production rebranded name — will be out in 2027.\nVW is betting that its newly “likeable” and affordable EVs will help lift its fortunes in the face of fierce competition from China, especially at the low end of the market. The German automaker, which also owns Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Skoda, Seat, and others, hasn’t had the same kind of EV success as its crosstown rival BMW, or even South Korean competitors like Hyundai and Kia. Its European sales have been a bright spot in an otherwise uneven portfolio, which may explain why the company isn’t making any commitments beyond the continent.",

      "raw": "A few years ago, artist Modern Biology became a viral sensation when he posted videos of himself controlling a modular synth with mushrooms on TikTok. Pocket Scion gives anyone similar capabilities, but without having to spend thousands of dollars on a Eurorack rig – and in a much more portable package. \nA core part of Modern Biology’s setup is a module called Scion from Glasgow-based Instruo. Scion turns biofeedback, whether that’s from houseplants or your own skin, into CV (control voltage) for controlling other synth modules in a larger setup. Touching two sensors to your hand or a mushroom completes a circuit, and then electrical fluctuations in that circuit can be used to trigger different notes, or change the cutoff on a filter, for instance.\nA little over a year ago, he approached Instruo about building something new. The fruit of that collaboration is the Pocket Scion, an affordable self-contained instrument that can turn small electrical changes from living organisms into MIDI data and create soundscapes using one of the four built-in sound engines. \nThe Pocket Scion has a number of advanced capabilities too, including MIDI out for controlling external instruments. There’s also a companion app for Windows, macOS, and Linux that exposes sound design tools for creating your own synth patches, and can send data over Open Sound Control (OSC), which gives it control over a ton of audio and video programs like Max/MSP, Pure Data, and Unreal Engine for creating visualization or complex reactive art installations. It’s more powerful than you’d expect given its $149 price.\nThe initial run of Pocket Scions sold out almost immediately. But you can place a preorder for when the next batch ships “early next week,” according to retailer Control Voltage.",

      "raw": "The RVSolar System living its best vanlife. | Image: Bluetti\t\n\nIt only took three years, but Bluetti is following EcoFlow’s lead with a fully integrated power system of its own to make vanlifers, off-grid cabins, and boats energy independent. The RVSolar System’s main advantage over bespoke systems is a relatively quick and easy installation, requiring just “30 minutes,” according to Bluetti’s announcement at IFA 2025. \nWhile it’s undoubtedly faster than installing a fully bespoke solution from Victron Energy, for example, the last time I installed EcoFlow’s comparable system, it took closer to five hours — and that was after several hours of planning, measuring, and double-checking. Thirty minutes is just the time needed to screw everything together, so there’s still a hint of truth here.\nBluetti’s 48V RVSolar System is capable of 5,000W of max AC output or 1,360W DC. That’s plenty of power for everything from a roof-mounted air conditioner and induction cooktop to a 12V water pump and lighting system. It can be configured with a whopping 122kWh of Bluetti’s self-heated LFP batteries — enough for me to live and work off the grid for as long as 76 days, based upon the 1.6kWh average that I consume daily in my own van. As a bonus, Bluetti’s system also supports compatible third-party batteries, which is something EcoFlow can’t claim with its proprietary connectors.\nMaxing out a system with batteries will be overkill for most since these systems are designed to be easily rechargeable when out in the sticks. Batteries connected to the system can be recharged from a number of sources, including solar panels (up to 3600W), shore-power hookup (up to 5000W), a diesel generator (up to 5000W), and your vehicle’s own alternator (up to 1200W).\n\n\n\n\nThe system is built around an RV5 Power Hub unit that houses all the devices, which typically have to be wired together separately in a bespoke installation. These include the DC-to-AC inverter to convert DC energy to AC power for the microwave or coffee machine, an MPPT solar charger to regulate solar panel input, a DC-DC charger to top up the batteries when the vehicle’s motor is running, and a DC converter to step down the voltage for 12V / 24V devices like lights, USB sockets, pumps, and modern A/C units. \nThe kit also comes with a smart distribution panel for 8 AC and 20 DC circuits, with remote control over four of those AC circuits and six DC. You also get a wired 10.1-inch control screen that can be installed at a central location in the vehicle for remote monitoring and circuit-level control — functionality that’s replicated in the Bluetti app.\nThe RVSolar System will be available globally on September 30th. Pricing information wasn’t available at the time of publication, but I’d expect it to be on par with Victron components, especially if it’s using third-party batteries.",
