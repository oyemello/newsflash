      "raw": "Dreame’s L20 Ultra is over 50 percent off, marking a new low price.\t\n\nNow, at the end of the summer, it’s still too hot to worry about cleaning, which is why robot vacuums like Dreame’s L20 Ultra can feel like a lifesaver. The L20 Ultra is a robot vacuum / mop hybrid that takes care of the dirty work — literally — while you stay cool, and is currently the most affordable it’s ever been at $449.99 ($550 off) from Dreame. \nSince it’s compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri Shortcuts, you don’t even have to get up to turn the robovac on — just tell it to start cleaning with your voice or tap the app. Its 7,000 Pa suction power vac will then suck up dirt and debris from your carpets, while AI-powered obstacle avoidance helps it move around clutter on the floor without getting stuck.\nDreame L20 Ultra\nThe high-end Dreame L20 Ultra is the least hands-on vacuum / mop you can buy. It can remove and reattach its oscillating mopping pads, wash and dry them, refill its water tank, and empty the bin. It can also do the splits with its mops to clean your baseboards better. The newer X30 Ultra has some improvements, but on balance, the L20 is still the best value. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999.99 $449.99 at Dreame\n $999.99 $539.99 at Amazon\n\nMeanwhile, if you need your floor really clean, its dual oscillating mopping pads extend to reach into hard-to-clean corners; when it detects carpet, the bot removes the pads to keep things dry. On top of that, the bot even washes and dries its own pads, refills its water tanks, and empties its bin, giving you one less chore to worry about. \nThree more deals worth your time\nYou can buy the latest Amazon Echo Show 5 for $64.99 ($25 off) at Amazon, Target, and Best Buy, which is just $5 shy of the 2025 all-time low price set during Amazon Prime Day. The 5.5-inch gadget improves upon its predecessor with clearer, more bass-rich sound, while continuing to serve as a great bedside alarm clock. You can also use the Alexa-enabled display to play music, make video calls with its 2-megapixel camera, control smart home devices like lights using just your voice, display photos and more. \nAnker’s 747 Charger (GaNPrime 150W) is on sale for $59.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and directly from Anker with code WSPDV2URXFKO, which matches its best price to date. Equipped with three USB-C ports and a single USB-A, the 150W portable charger can power four devices at once, including smartphones, tablets, e-readers, and more. You can even use it to quickly charge two laptops, making it a handy companion for working while on the go.\nGovee’s 15-inch Smart RGBIC Wi-Fi TV Light Bars are down to $44.99 ($25 off) at Amazon, which is its best price since February and $5 shy of its all-time low. The 150-lumen light bars feature multiple lighting and color effects as well as music modes to elevate your entertainment setup. You can mount them behind the back of any 45- to 70-inch TV for immersive backlighting, though they work just as well as stylish shelf lights. Plus, they support hands-free voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.",

You truly cannot make this stuff up. \nIn case you don’t remember, Tesla released the refreshed the”Highland” Model 3, first in China in 2023, and the rest of the world in 2024. In addition to some design tweaks and an additional touchscreen for rear passengers, the updated electric sedan was notable for what it lacked. Tesla had deleted the turn signal and drive stalks, moving the controls to steering wheel buttons and the center touchscreen and relying on automation. \nThe decision seemed inspired by Tesla’s desire for maximal minimalism, removing controls it assumed would eventually become obsolete in an era of autonomous vehicles. But it turns out (pun intended) the turn signal stalk is just one of those controls that most people would prefer to keep. Many Tesla owners confessed to hating their stalk-less cockpits and openly wishing that Tesla would bring them back. \nIt would appear that Tesla has heard their pleas, though its unlikely that owners will appreciate having to pay for the privilege of adding back a turn signal stalk. We’ll see if Tesla eventually brings the retrofit stalk to the US, and at what price.",

      "raw": "Microsoft Excel is testing a new AI-powered function that can automatically fill cells in your spreadsheets, which is similar to the feature that Google Sheets rolled out in June. You would use the “COPILOT” function followed by a natural language prompt and (optionally) specify the cells you want it to reference; the AI would then classify information, generate summaries, create tables, and more.\nIf you have a column of cells filled with feedback about a coffee machine, for example, you can use the COPILOT function to quickly classify it with AI. To do this, you’d use this formula: “=COPILOT(“Classify this feedback”, D4:D18),” while ensuring that you change the cells to match your Excel sheet. Microsoft Excel will then output AI-generated classifications inside each specified cell.\nHere are some other examples provided by Microsoft: \nGenerate text: =COPILOT(“Create a description for this product based on its specs”, B2:B8)\nSummarize text: =COPILOT(“Summarize this feedback”, A2:A20)\nThe COPILOT function, which is powered by OpenAI’s gpt-4.1-mini AI model, is the successor to the LABS.GENERATIVEAI function Microsoft started experimenting with in 2023. \nMicrosoft notes that you can combine its new AI function with other Excel functions, including IF, SWITCH, LAMBDA, or WRAPROWS. The company adds that information sent through Excel’s COPILOT function is “never” used for AI training, as “the input remains confidential and is used solely to generate your requested output.”\nThe COPILOT function comes with a couple of limitations, as it can’t access information outside your spreadsheet, and you can only use it to calculate 100 functions every 10 minutes. Microsoft also warns against using the AI function for numerical calculations or in “high-stakes scenarios” with legal, regulatory, and compliance implications, as COPILOT “can give incorrect responses.”\nIt’s rolling out now to users on Windows and Mac in the Beta Channel with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license. Microsoft plans on refining this feature in the future by upgrading the function’s underlying model and potentially adding support for web access.",

      "raw": "The Switch 2 exclusive list is getting longer with the racing game Kirby Air Riders coming to the console on November 20th. Today, Nintendo offered a luxurious 45 minutes devoted to its cutest pink blob who, when you think about it, is really an eldritch horror of incalculable power. Here are the highlights from the Kirby Air Riders Direct.\nBefore even getting to the action of Air Riders, we were greeted with a smiling but tired sigh from director (and Kirby’s dad) Masahiro Sakurai. He explained that he was approached to lead Air Riders while he was working on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate DLC, and that the new Kirby is a collaboration between his studio Sora and Bandai Namco. \n\nKirby Air Riders takes the original GameCube classic and modernizes it for the Switch 2. You can choose many more riders to play as instead of just Kirby including King Dedede, Banana Waddle Dee, and some cool-looking guy I just heard of named Knuckle Joe. The game also supports up to eight players in local wireless play or up to 16 players online. \nAnd what will you do with those other 15 players? There’s races, point challenges, battle arenas, and good ole’ fashioned exploration. In Air Riders you can choose any number of racing machines, each with their own unique traits, and upgrade them to your hearts content. Is your paper glider machine too fragile? Spend some time exploring, gathering power ups to make it beefier. Then use your newly improved machine in a challenge designed to take advantage of your racer’s new stats.\nKirby Air Riders is the first game directed by Masahiro Sakurai ever since Nintendo’s tiredest soldier finished up work on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. In the interim, he’s been running a series of educational videos on YouTube sharing his experiences and lessons learned in game development while also, apparently, directing Air Riders. \nThat Kirby Air Riders is showing up now along with *inhales* Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, has bolstered my Kirby Theory of Distress which hypothesizes that Nintendo releases a Kirby game whenever the world is in worse than average trouble. Kirby comes to save us once again in Kirby Air Riders launching on the Switch 2 November 20th.\nIn the meantime, Switch Online subscribers can get an early taste of the game’s soundtrack through the Nintendo Music app, which just added seven tracks ahead of Air Riders’ launch.",

Shipping is expected to start as early as October 2025. Although the company is concurrently running another Indiegogo campaign for a similar dual-screen handheld called the Flip 1S, that device features more powerful specs, runs Windows 11, and starts at $1,279 with discounts, while the less expensive Pocket DS runs Android 13.\nThere are currently many handhelds that replicate the design and functionality of Nintendo’s iconic portables, including the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance, but few can properly recreate the Nintendo DS experience, which is still Nintendo’s best-selling console of all time. The new Pocket DS potentially fits that bill with a 7-inch, 16:9, 1080P OLED folding top screen paired with a smaller 5-inch, 4:3, 1,024×768 LCD display on the handheld itself.\nIt will be powered by a very capable Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 processor, but we don’t yet know what the Pocket DS’ emulation capabilities will be. The entry-level model features 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (expandable through a microSD card slot), but the Pocket DS can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, pushing its price to $759, or $639 with early backer discounts.\nThe handheld also features a pair of anti-drift TMR joysticks, Hall effect triggers with sensitivity adjustments, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, gyroscopic controls, a fingerprint scanning power button, and an 8,000mAh battery. Ayaneo hasn’t revealed the handheld’s actual battery life, but it will offer multiple performance modes and the ability to turn off the second screen for those trying to max out their playtime.",

Now rolling out in beta for “eligible Premium users,” the Mix feature provides an option to automatically blend transitions between tracks, or manually adjust aspects like volume, EQ, and effect curves while looking at waveform and beat data to create unique transitions.\nThis allows users to make songs flow into each other instead of just letting one track abruptly finish and another begin. It sounds like an easy way to experiment with basic audio mixing features before getting to grips with more extensive mixing software such as Apple Logic Pro, Reaper, or Audacity. You could use it just to enhance your own listening experience, or provide a better “DJ” experience when you’re in charge of the aux cable at parties or social gatherings.\nSpotify says that Premium users can also collaborate with each other to create mixed playlists. It’s unclear when this feature will be available outside of beta, or which Premium users currently have access. Spotify says you’ll need to make sure your app is up to date, but I’m not seeing it available on my own premium account for iOS in the UK. I’ve asked Spotify for more details about availability.\nPremium users who do have access to the Mix feature will see it appear in the toolbar on playlists that they have created. Alongside the “Auto” option to quickly create transitions, the customization options include presets for “Fade” or “Rise” to easily apply different transition styles. When you’re happy with the transitions for each track in the playlist, hit “Save” to listen to the results. If you want to listen to the unmixed version of the same playlist, you can toggle the transitions on or off by pressing the “Mix” button.",

Its long-lasting LFP chemistry and 2,000W inverter combine during a blackout to keep devices like a router, fridge/freezer, and some lights running for a few hours, and it’s portable enough for a weekend barbecue, outdoor movie night, or to drop into the car for an outdoor getaway.\nAnd like all power stations it comes slathered in ports, including 5x standard wall jacks, 3x USB-C (2x 140W, 1x 15W), 1x USB-A, and 1x 120W cigarette socket to power devices like a portable fridge or coffee maker. It weighs 24.9 pounds (11.3kg), can function as a UPS when otherwise idle, accepts up to 1600W of charging power from a standard wall jack, and up to 600W from attached solar panels so it can function as a solar generator.\nThe Anker Solix C1000 Gen 2 portable power station is available for just $429 if you register interest before September 8th, after which it increases to $799.",

As with the original that debuted in early 2023, the new Nanoleaf 4D V2 is a cheaper and simpler alternative to products that integrate with your home theater using HDMI, like the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box 8K that launched last year at $350 and has seen its price increase to as much as $385.\nThe Nanoleaf 4D V2 is available today through the company’s online store for $99.99, and will come to Amazon and Best Buy in September. That’s the same price as the original kit, but while Nanoleaf previously sold the 4D in two sizes for TVs up to 85 inches, the new 4D V2 kit is only designed for screens up to 65 inches.\nPowered by a better color-matching algorithm, Nanoleaf says the included LED light strip and camera with the 4D V2 can make both whites and colors look brighter and more vivid. It features a new zigzag design that’s lighter and more flexible, so it’s potentially easier to install around the perimeter of the back of your TV without the need for supportive corner brackets. Like the original, the light strip can be trimmed with scissors to better fit smaller TVs, and the lighting effects will automatically readjust for the shorter length.\nBoth the light strip and camera connect to a small control box that can be powered over USB-C. It offers four modes, including ambient lighting with slower transitions or faster color changes that more closely mirror what’s happening on screen. The box also connects to Nanoleaf’s mobile and desktop apps, and using the company’s Sync Plus feature, it can control other Nanoleaf lighting products to expand your immersive TV experience to an entire room.",

So if anyone tries to eat you, they’ll be exposed to something called a cardiotonic steroid — and may die of a heart attack. Well, unfortunately, for you, some animals have developed adaptations to these toxic steroids. Evolutionary biologist Shabnam Mohammadi has spent her career studying how these adaptations work — and says even humans have used these toxins to their advantage since ancient Egypt. So today on Short Wave, we get a little… toxic (cue Brittney Spears). Host Regina G. Barber talks to Shabnam about how some predators can get away with eating toxic prey. \n\nCurious about biology?
