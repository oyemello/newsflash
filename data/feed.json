And those were the three major issues that we grappled with over the course of the last three days …\nOne of the defining outcomes of this economic reform roundtable was building consensus and momentum around ensuring that intergenerational fairness is one of the defining principles of our country, but also of our government.

      "raw": "Bungie CEO Pete Parsons has announced that he’s leaving the company one decade after taking on the role. In an update on Thursday, Parsons wrote that he has “decided to pass the torch” to longtime Bungie developer Justin Truman.\nParsons has worked at Bungie for over 20 years and led the studio through the launch of Destiny 2 in 2017, along with the release of its major expansion pack, The Final Shape.\nIn 2022, Sony Interactive Entertainment purchased Bungie for $3.6 billion. The studio has since contended with the layoffs of hundreds of workers and delayed its extraction shooter Marathon following lackluster alpha test feedback. In May, an artist accused Bungie of using their work in Marathon without permission.\n“We’ve been through so much together: we launched a bold new chapter for Destiny, built an enviable, independent live ops organization capable of creating and publishing its own games, and joined the incredible family at Sony Interactive Entertainment,” Parsons writes.\nTruman joined Bungie in 2010 and became chief development officer in 2022. He says the team is “currently heads down” on both Marathon and Destiny, adding that “we’ll have more to show you in both of these worlds later this year.”",

      "raw": "Photo by Max Braun (Wikimedia Commons)\t\n\nGoogle’s new Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Pixel Watch 4 may compete with Samsung, but it’s happy to let Samsung explore other parts of the Galaxy on its own. In interviews with Bloomberg, Google just revealed a lot of devices it isn’t currently working on. Here’s Bloomberg:\nDespite its partners Samsung and Motorola getting into flip-style phones where the screens opens up vertically like an old school Motorola Razr, Google says it intends to sit out that race. It’s also not currently working on a smart ring and has paused development on a tablet overhaul until it figures out a meaningful future for the category, executives said.\nPretty sure that’s the first true confirmation that the Pixel Tablet 2 was canceled! Remember when Google was done with tablets in 2019?\nAnd though Google has repeatedly teased its own prototype glasses and even let us try them on, it appears that Google devices boss Rick Osterloh isn’t sure it’ll actually manufacture any glasses for sale: \nOsterloh says it’s still “TBD” whether Google itself will release glasses again, but he’s intent on the category being part of the company’s future.\nTo be fair, Google has almost always shown off those glasses prototypes alongside the XR headsets it’s co-developing with Samsung, and — like Meta — it seems more interested in making Android XR a platform for other glasses partners too. \nIf Google were to release glasses again, though, Bloomberg did get one interesting hint about how they might work. Osterloh and his deputy Shakil Barkat suggested in the interview that display-free glasses might pair nicely with a smaller phone, one that could unfold for your entertainment needs as well. But, again, it sounds like Google wants to “sit out” Razr-style folding flip phones for now.  \nGoogle would hesitate before announcing glasses, I bet, because of its infamous fails with the original Google Glass. We ranked it near the very top of the list in our 84 biggest flops of the past decade in tech, though I imagine a modern version would get a less frosty reception in the post Meta Ray-Ban world.\nLastly, if you’re curious when Pixel phone design might change again, perhaps away from big camera bumps, design chief Ivy Ross told Bloomberg that the company tries on new design languages “every two to three years.” That means it’s due.",

      "raw": "Jennifer Pattison Tuohy is a senior reviewer at The Verge covering the smart home, Internet of Things, and, as she puts it, “as many kitchen gadgets as I can get my hands on.” In her four years here, she’s tested everything from smart locks, lights, and doorbells to robot vacuums (some with arms), robot lawnmowers, and an actual home robot. But, she says, “the heart of my home is my kitchen, and I love a good smart kitchen gadget. I’ve tested a smart trash can, smart mixer, smart pizza oven, smart ice maker, and yes, even a smart fridge. But none of these could ever replace my favorite kitchen gadget — my Le Creuset sauté pan.”   \nWhen did you get your Le Creuset pan?\nMy Le Creuset pan was a wedding gift. I’m about to celebrate my 20th wedding anniversary, so it’s been around a while! \nIts official name is Le Creuset Signature Enameled Cast Iron Deep Saute Pan, 4 1/4-Qt., and you can only get it at Williams Sonoma, which I discovered when I tried to buy one as a wedding gift for my brother-in-law. I did buy it for them, and I also got one for my sister-in-law as her wedding gift a few years later! Thankfully, I am now out of in-laws to buy them for. They’re not cheap.\nWhat do you use it for?\nI use it almost every time I cook a meal. It’s hands down the best, most versatile pan I’ve ever owned. Some of my favorite dishes to cook in it are frittatas, stews, and bolognese sauce (it can simmer in the oven with the lid on at 200 degrees for 8 hours). \nI also use it for searing meats like chicken thighs and pork cops. It’s also great for fish, and I love to make Yorkshire puddings, Dutch baby pancakes, and even the occasional pizza in it.\nWhat do you like about it?\nI love that it’s big enough to cook a beef stew or a whole batch of soup, while also easy to just scramble eggs in. I also love that it has a handle and a lid and that everything can go in the oven — up to 500 degrees! And it all goes in the dishwasher — though I generally hand-wash it, as it takes up an entire rack.\nLe Creuset cookware is known for its enameled cast-iron, which has amazing heat distribution, so it’s my go-to for any searing, browning, or sauteing. The best thing is how much surface area it has, which makes browning meats easy to do in one batch.\nPlus, its super deep sides mean I can cook a one-pot meal in it without things flying out the sides when I’m stirring. It’s perfect for all-in-one dishes like pork stroganoff, risotto, my favorite Mexican beef-’n’-rice dish, and any combination of protein, sauté-able veggies, and a nice pan sauce, like this Creamy Tuscan Chicken dish I make regularly.\nIs there anything you don’t like about it, or that you’d improve if you could?\nOther than the price, the only downside is its weight. At 13 pounds, it weighs almost as much as a 6-month-old baby, so it’s almost always a two-hander. My grandmother was a professional cook, and she swore by Le Creuset pans. But as she got older, she complained that she couldn’t use them anymore, as they were too heavy.\nI also have not been a model Le Creuset owner; the enamel inside is far from pristine, but I still use it all the time and don’t see any need to replace it.\nAs someone who reviews the latest tech gadgets — many of which, in the best-case scenario, have a 10-year lifespan — pulling out a 20-year-old pan each night to cook dinner gives me a nice feeling of permanence and tradition.\nLe Creuset Signature Enameled Cast Iron Deep Sauté Pan\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $368 at Williams Sonoma",

Thankfully, you can get a 77-inch LG C5 OLED TV for around $2,496.99 ($1,203 off), its lowest price ever at Amazon, B&H Photo, and Best Buy.\nLG C5 OLED TV\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $3699.99 $2496.99 at Amazon (77-inch)\n $3699.99 $2496.99 at B&H Photo (77-inch)\n $3699.99 $2499.99 at Best Buy (77-inch)\n\nThe C5 has a 120Hz panel, four HDMI 2.1 ports and support for both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, so gamers can play PC and current-generation console titles in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. LG says its custom-designed processor can upscale lower quality video to look cleaner on a large, 4K set. The processor also enables AI Picture Pro, a feature that analyzes what you’re watching and adjusts the TV’s settings — including brightness, resolution, and clarity — in real time to present the best picture.\nLG says the C5’s Perfect Black and Perfect Color features allow the TV’s picture to look great in bright rooms, which OLED TVs have struggled with in the past. It also supports both HDR10 and Dolby Vision, so games and videos encoded in those formats will have better color and contrast. A benefit of picking up an OLED TV is that each pixel is illuminated individually, so you completely avoid blooming, which is what happens when a TV has to increase the brightness of a larger section of the set to accommodate a bright object. Blooming can be distracting once you notice it, but that’s a non-issue with the C5. \nMore deals worth checking out \nNeed a new pair of headphones for travel? Sony’s WH-1000XM5s are $273.99 ($126 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is their lowest price since Prime Day. In our tests, the headphones had excellent active noise cancellation, high quality sound, and a jump in voice call quality and comfort over their predecessors. Their battery lasts around 30 hours, which is more than enough time to get you through an international trip. Read our review.\nIf your wireless Xbox Series X|S controllers are constantly running out of juice, the 8BitDo Charging Dock for Xbox Wireless Controllers can help, and it’s currently $19.99 ($5 off) at Amazon. It comes with a 1,100mAh rechargeable battery for your controller, which has pins on the back that correspond to pins on the dock. Your controller will automatically begin charging when you set it on the dock, and a light will turn from amber to white when its battery is full.\nNebula’s X1 is one of the best projectors we’ve reviewed recently, and it’s currently around $2,549 ($450 off) at Amazon and from Nebula (with code WS24D2351US). In our tests, the 3,500 lumen projector created an incredibly bright image that looked great on several surfaces (including a bare wall) in rooms with different levels of light pollution. Its built-in speaker also provided surprisingly clear room-filling sound. Read our review.",

      "raw": "Tesla is under investigation for failing to report crashes involving its partially autonomous driving technology in a timely manner.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires automakers to report crashes involving advanced driver assist features “within one or five days” of the incident, but Tesla was reporting crashes “several months or more” after they occurred, the agency said. \nTesla has told NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation that the delays were the result of a problem with its data collection that has since been fixed. But the agency is still opening an audit investigation as standard procedure to ensure the company is doing everything by the book.\nThe rule dates back to a standing general order (SGO) from 2021 that requires automakers and robotaxi companies to report crashes involving fully autonomous vehicles as well as Level 2 driver-assist systems. Under the SGO, companies are required to document collisions when an automated driving system was in use within 30 seconds of impact and report those incidents to the government. \nSince it was implemented, Tesla has reported over 2,300 crashes to the federal government, according to NHTSA. An analysis of the crash data shows Tesla accounted for 40 out of 43 fatal crashes reported under the SGO.\nTesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features are considered Level 2 automated technology that requires full driver attention. By comparison, Alphabet’s Waymo uses Level 4 technology that doesn’t require a human driver. \nEarlier this year, NHTSA proposed revising the SGO to remove some of the reporting requirements.",
