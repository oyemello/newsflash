      "raw": "Hisense’s S7N 55-inch TV doubles as a framed work of art.\t\n\nIt’s hard to realize that Labor Day weekend — signalling the end of summer — is already here. It would be a bit depressing, except that the weekend also brings with it some really good deal. For example, you can nab a Hisense S7N 55-inch TV at Best Buy and Amazon for $699.99, a solid $300 off its usual $999.99 and only $11 higher than its all-time low. This is part of the Hisense CanvasTV series, which is designed to hang flat against your wall as if it were a painting and display art or photos when it’s not in use.\nHisense S7N TV\nThis 4K QLED display is designed to hang flat against your wall as if it were a painting and display art or photos when it’s not in use. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999.99 $699.99 at Amazon\n $999.99 $699.99 at Best Buy\n\nThe S7N has a 4K QLED display with an anti-glare coating so that it shows art — or your favorite TV shows — to their best advantage, regardless of your viewing angle. If you plan to use it for gaming as well, it supports variable refresh rate between 48Hz to 144Hz, plus multichannel surround sound (however, you may just want a separate soundbar, since TV audio isn’t immersive). It runs Google TV and offers four HDMI (two of which are HDMI 2.1, which support 4K/120Hz on modern consoles) and two USB ports. And it will only power on when it senses somebody nearby.\nBut, of course, the main attraction of this TV is its ability to mimic a work of art, something that can add a bit of class to your wall. \nOther Verge-approved deals\nOne of the favorite add-ons among The Verge’s crew is Elgato’s Stream Deck, which lets you customize real buttons (as opposed to capacitive) to do a wide range of tasks with just a quick tap. The Stream Deck Neo is a wired command center that comes with eight programmable buttons, will work with Macs and Windows PCs, and is compatible with many apps. It’s now on sale for $79.99 (a $20 savings) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H.\nWoot is having a Labor Day celebration of sorts called Toyapolooza. If you buy four or more items listed in its toy sale, you’ll get an extra 30 percent off — buy 10 or more and get an extra 70 percent off. There’s a lot to choose from, including a Masters of the Universe Power Sword Set ($42), a 30-piece set of National Geographic Building Blocks ($14.99), and a Fisher-Price DC Super Friends Playset ($12.99). \nSpeaking of toys, if you’re into Star Wars Lego models, you can score a Lego Star Wars Tantive IV Build and Display Starship Vehicle at Best Buy for $51.19, approximately $13 less than its usual $63.99 price. This set contains 654 pieces, making it a suitable weekend project.\nSamsung is presenting its latest Unpacked launch event on September 4th, and so it’s running a promotion for anyone who reserves its newest Galaxy Tab devices, sight unseen. If you follow through on your free reservation and buy the product between September 4th and October 5th, you can take advantage of a $50 credit, $150 toward a storage upgrade, up to 20 percent off “select Galaxy devices,” and other offers. For those who are part of the Samsung ecosystem, it may be worth checking out.",

      "raw": "Tesla is offering a new performance version of its Model Y crossover for the European market. The new variant is aimed at boosting the company’s sales on the continent, which have been in free fall for most of the year thanks to growing competition from China and brand damage from Elon Musk’s fascist antics. \nThe Model Y Performance, which will go on sale in September, looks to be a step above the base model in most categories. It will be quicker, accelerating from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.5 seconds, as compared to 4.8 seconds for the regular Model Y. It will have longer range, with an estimated 580 km (360 miles) based on the more generous WLTP standard. And it will have 460 horsepower, up from the 265 hp available in the rear-wheel drive model. \n\nThe improved performance hasn’t come at the expense of efficiency, which Tesla cites as thanks to “new, high-density battery cells.” The Model Y Performance will be able to add 243 km (151 miles) of range in 15 minutes. And the battery should consume power at a rate of 16.2 kWh/100 km. \nTesla has also made some tweaks to the look of the Model Y, adding new front and rear fascia and a carbon-fiber spoiler for improved aerodynamics. And the wheels are new 21-inchers, as compared to the 19- and 20-inch ones for the RWD and Long Range versions of the Model Y. \nInside the vehicle, Tesla has added some badging that looks similar to the Plaid themes used in its other performance vehicles. It also slightly increased the size of the center touchscreen to 16 inches from 15.4. The drive quality should be better thanks to adaptive damping adjustments and new drive modes for “high-speed driving.” This could be similar to the Tesla Model Y L upgrade that was just released in China, which has been praised for its improved road handling. \nBut the big question hanging over this new variant is whether it will help turn around Tesla’s fortunes in Europe. The automaker’s sales plunged a staggering 42 percent in July as buyers flocked to Chinese brands like BYD. This continued a trend we’ve been seeing over the course of the year, with Tesla’s sales dropping each month in the EU since January. Meanwhile, BYD’s July sales were up 225 percent. The drop in sales coincided with Musk’s move to the right, including his support for Germany’s right-wing AfD party. \nTesla has pinned its hopes on robotics and self-driving cars to help turn things around. But the automaker hasn’t received regulatory approval to sell its Full Self-Driving feature in the EU, limiting the company’s efforts to push that particular narrative on the continent. \nThe Model Y Performance starts at €62,000 (approximately $73,000) in Germany — though prices will vary country by country.",

UK users won’t even be able to access the community hubs of mature content games unless a valid credit card is stored on a Steam account.\nWhile platforms like Reddit, Bluesky, and Discord have opted for age verification checks using selfies, Valve is restricting its age checks to just credit cards, according to a support article. “Among all age assurance mechanisms reviewed by Valve, this process preserves the maximum degree of user privacy,” says Valve. “Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons.”\nIn the UK you need to be 18 years of age to obtain a credit card, so this passes the age checks onto banks instead of Valve having to perform them. If you don’t have a credit card then you won’t be able to access mature content games or pages on Steam, as there’s no other way of verifying your age.\nValve’s decision to require a credit card comes weeks after the UK’s new age-gating rules have been found to be easy to bypass, especially with VPNs. Discord and Reddit’s UK age verification could be briefly defeated by Death Stranding’s photo mode, but the face scanning tools have since been updated to block this bypass method.\nMicrosoft has also started rolling out Xbox age verification in the UK. While the age verification checks are optional right now, they will become a requirement to access a variety of Xbox services in early 2026, when additional parts of the UK’s Online Safety Act come into force.",

The new union includes game developers, artists, designers, engineers, and support staff across the Diablo franchise, according to the Communications Workers of America (CWA) press release, which voted “strongly in favor” to be represented by the CWA.\nThe Diablo team is seeking to improve compensation, job security, and workplace conditions under its Microsoft parent company. Over 3,500 employees at Microsoft are now in CWA unions, including more than 500 World of Warcraft developers who formed Blizzard’s first wall-to-wall union last year. Microsoft laid off as many as 9,100 employees earlier this year, and 1,900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox in 2024.\n“With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I’ve witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us,” said Kelly Yeo, an organizing committee member for the Diablo union. “This is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of living in fear.”",

The most notable gadget shared by reputable leaker Evan Blass shows an image of a concept laptop design with a display that rotates between landscape and portrait orientations, which Lenovo has reportedly dubbed “Project Pivo.”\nLenovo has a history of making funky laptop concepts — such as the see-through ThinkBook Transparent Display Laptop and the rollable display on the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 — but these R&D projects aren’t guaranteed to be released as consumer products. The portrait mode for Project Pivo could be a useful feature for coding and viewing the mobile versions of websites and apps, so we’ll have to see if it turns into something that you can actually buy.\nAccording to Blass, Lenovo will also be showing off the Legion Go 2, the second-gen gaming handheld announced during CES that’s expected to launch sometime this year, and a selection of tablets and Motorola phones. I’ll be checking out what Lenovo has to offer during the IFA event, so more information about these products should be available next week if they make an appearance.",

      "raw": "“Actual features are subject to the official product release.” | Image: Dangbei\t\n\nDangbei is bringing its S7 Ultra Max all-in-one projector to Berlin next week for the big IFA tech show. That’s a good indication that the China-only 4K projector with a ridiculously bright 6,200 ISO lumen output is preparing for a global launch.\nHere’s the teaser Dangbei just sent to my inbox:\nExperience cinema-grade brilliance with this laser projector, featuring 48 RGB laser units, 6,200 ISO lumens, and Dolby Vision/HDR10+ for unparalleled visuals.\nWhen this 4K projector was announced in China back in July, Dangbei said it achieved class-leading brightness by combining 48 laser-light sources. But it claimed “5800 CVIA lumens” back then, and CVIA typically delivers a higher brightness value than the stricter ISO and ANSI standards. So there’s reason to be skeptical of the higher 6,200 ISO lumen claim.\nHere’s the subtitled launch from a few months ago:\n\nAnd like Anker’s very bright 3500 ANSI lumen Nebula X1 projector I recently reviewed, the S7 Ultra Max is liquid cooled to tame all the heat its projection tech produces while reducing the noise to a very quiet 24dB, according to the company. Other features include dual 15W speakers, a stated 8000:1 native contrast ratio, 0.98 to 1.6:1 optical zoom, and a base that swivels and rotates to find the best image placement, with automatic focus, keystone correction, and screen alignment to dial things in.\nAll this for a price of just 15,999 yuan, which converts to about $2,250. Too good to be true? Possibly, we’ll see what Dangbei has to say next week in Berlin.",
