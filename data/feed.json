A single court is handling both cases in parallel, even though they weren’t filed at the same time. \nOn Tuesday, federal judge Jonathan Beach found that Apple and Google misused their app marketplace dominance and in-app purchase commission fees of up to 30 percent to reduce competition, the Australian Financial Review reports. However, Beach rejected Epic’s claims that the tech giants had broken consumer law or engaged in “unconscionable conduct” — meaning particularly harsh, unfair, or oppressive behavior that goes against societal norms. We are still awaiting further details from Beach’s final judgment, which is more than 2,000 pages long and won’t be released publicly.\n\n\nThe Epic Games Store and Fortnite will come to iOS in Australia! An Australian court just found that Apple and Google abuse their control over app distribution and in-app payments to limit competition. There are 2,000+ pages of findings that we’ll need to dig into to fully…\n— Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) August 12, 2025\n\n\n“We welcome the court’s rejection of Epic’s demands that we distribute app stores from within the Google Play store, and Epic’s attacks on other critical security protections that users rely on,” Google spokesperson Dan Jackson said in a statement to The Verge. \n“However, we disagree with the court’s characterization of our billing policies and practices, as well as its findings regarding some of our historical partnerships, which were all shaped in a fiercely competitive mobile landscape on behalf of users and developers,” Jackson said. “We will review the full decision when we receive it and assess our next steps.”\nIn a statement to Australia’s ABC News, an unnamed Apple spokesperson said that the company welcomes the court’s rejection of some of Epic’s claims, but that it disagrees with other aspects of the ruling. “Apple faces fierce competition in every market where we operate,” the spokesperson said. “We continuously invest and innovate to make the App Store the safest place for users to get apps and a great business opportunity for developers in Australia and around the world.”\nEpic originally sued Apple and Google in the United States on August 13th, 2020, in two separate cases which went before two separate judges, with dramatically different results in each case. Epic largely lost its fight against Apple after attempting to take the fight all the way to the US Supreme Court, but Apple may lose a large degree of control over its App Store anyhow because it failed to comply with the district court’s order.\nAfter removing Fortnite from the App Store in 2020 amid its feud with Epic, Apple later brought the game back to its iPhone app marketplace in May. Fortnite also returned to iPhones in the EU last year, but only via the Epic Games Store for iOS.\nMeanwhile in the US version of the Google trial, Epic has continually won: in late 2023, a jury unanimously decided that Google turned its Play Store and Play Billing system into an illegal monopoly, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals just affirmed that decision at the end of July.\nThat decision could blow up Google’s control over its app store within weeks or months, unless Google gets the Ninth Circuit to grant a stay while it appeals to the US Supreme Court or grants a full en banc review of the three-judge panel’s decision. Google is arguing that the Apple decision should be relevant to the Google decision, but so far US courts disagree.",

      "raw": "Did Tesla remotely deactivate a Cybertruck in the middle of a highway because the owner featured it in an unauthorized music video? The story already seemed highly unlikely, and on Monday afternoon, Tesla tweeted about the video, saying, “This is fake – that’s not our screen. Tesla does NOT disable vehicles remotely.”\nOn Sunday, Instagram user @bighuey313 posted a video of his supposed deactivated Cybertruck, complete with a flashing red warning message on the truck’s main touchscreen. “Dog wtf my cybertruck just shut off on the freeway! 😡” he wrote in the caption. “Almost just crashed wtf @teslamotors.”\nThe owner also posted an image of what he claimed was a cease-and-desist letter from Tesla’s vice president of legal affairs, Dinna Eskin. The letter cites “unauthorized use of Tesla’s intellectual property in musical content distributed under your name.” \nThe video quickly went viral on BlueSky, where anti-Elon Musk sentiment has helped fuel nationwide protests against Tesla. But users quickly noticed a number of discrepancies, such as the fact that the letter opens “We represent Tesla” despite being signed by the company’s in-house counsel. The letter also uses Eskin’s old title, “Sr. Director and Deputy General Counsel,” despite her current title of VP. And the warning message isn’t formatted like Tesla’s typical in-vehicle alerts and notifications. An X user speculated that the flashing red title was likely just a YouTube video playing on fullscreen to simulate a legitimate error. \nDespite these issues, the video went viral on BlueSky, X, and Reddit — and likely will continue to travel far and wide, confirming many people’s prior opinions about Tesla and Elon Musk. \nUpdate August 11th: Tesla posted on X confirming the video is fake.",

      "raw": "On Monday, Anthropic released a hotly anticipated memory function for its Claude chatbot.\nIn a YouTube video, the company demonstrated a user asking what they had been chatting about with Claude before their vacation. Claude searches past chats to read and summarize them for the user, then asks if they’d like to move on and keep working on the same project.\n“Never lose track of your work again,” the company wrote. “Claude now remembers your past conversations, so you can seamlessly continue projects, reference previous discussions, and build on your ideas without starting from scratch every time.” \n\nThe feature works across web, desktop, and mobile, and it can keep different projects and workspaces separate. It started rolling out to Claude’s Max, Team, and Enterprise subscription tiers today — just go to “Settings” under “Profile” and switch the feature on under “Search and reference chats” — and the company said other plans should receive access soon.\nBut there’s an important caveat here: It’s not yet a persistent memory feature like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Claude will only retrieve and reference your past chats when you ask it to, and it’s not building a user profile, according to Anthropic spokesperson Ryan Donegan.\nAnthropic and OpenAI have been going head-to-head in the AI arms race for quite a while, racing to roll out competing features and functionalities — like voice modes, larger context windows, and new subscription tiers — as they both raise ever-increasing funding amounts. Last week, OpenAI launched GPT-5, and Anthropic is currently looking to close a round that could value it as high as $170 billion.\nMemory functions are another way leading AI companies are looking to attract and keep users on one chatbot service, increasing “stickiness” and user engagement.\nChatbots’ memory functions have been the subject of online debate in recent weeks, as ChatGPT has been both lauded and lambasted for its references to users’ past conversations, with some users controversially treating it as a therapist and others experiencing mental health struggles that some are referring to as “ChatGPT psychosis.”",

The screen also displays status messages letting you know when the filter or vacuum bag needs replacing, or if a clog is detected.\nThe Electro connects to Miele’s mobile app over Wi-Fi giving you another option for staying on top of those important status messages.

Right now, you can buy the 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 for $269.99 ($30 off), while the 46mm is $319.99 ($30 off). Even the OnePlus Watch 2 is cheaper than it’s ever been at $199.99 ($100 off). Students get an additional 10 percent off, making these deals even sweeter.\nWe’ve recommended the OnePlus Watch 2 as a great alternative to Google and Samsung smartwatches since its debut, and the Watch 3 builds upon it with small, but meaningful upgrades. It retains everything we loved in its predecessor, like dual-frequency GPS and long battery life, but now adds Google Gemini, a rotating crown that scrolls, and video watch faces. The company also added its 60S Health Check-In, which provides a quick snapshot of your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age (with European users also getting EKGs) with a click of a button.\nThe OnePlus Watch 3 comes in two sizes: a new 43mm model introduced in July, and a 46mm version released back in April. Both are similar in terms of specs, but the 43mm model skips the 46mm’s temperature sensor that was used for reproductive cycle tracking and fall detection. The 46mm wearable also boasts a larger, brighter 2,200-nit OLED display, which is double the brightness of the 43mm version (1000 nits).\nRead our hands-on impressions of the OnePlus Watch 3.\nOnePlus Watch 3\nThe OnePlus Watch 3 builds upon the OnePlus Watch 2 with a new 43mm size and rotating crown bezel.
