      "raw": "This is an official Pixel 10 image released by Google, though it’s probably the Pro.\t\n\nGoogle is readying its next set of hardware announcements, and has already confirmed that the Pixel 10 series is launching this month. We even know what two of the phones look like, thanks to official teasers from Google.\nBut beyond the few tidbits Google has shared officially, there’s an awful lot more we think we know about the Pixel 10 line thanks to leaks, from which phones are arriving — likely the 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold — to camera changes, US prices, and maybe even some long overdue Qi2 support.\nWhat we know officially\nLet’s start with some stone-cold facts. We know that the Pixel 10 line will be announced at a Made by Google event in New York on August 20th, where the company will show off “the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds, and more.”\nWe also know that one of the phones in the lineup will look like the image above, including that blue-gray finish. Color aside, that phone looks almost identical to the Pixel 9 Pro, right down to the flash and temperature sensor inside the camera bar, confirming that Google isn’t changing its design language.\nYou can also see a little more of it in action in this early ad, which doesn’t miss the excuse to dunk on Apple for its repeated Apple Intelligence delays.\n\nWe’ve had a pretty similar tease for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which mostly shows that the foldable a) comes in the same grayish color as the other model, and b) otherwise looks an awful lot like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\n\nThat’s about all Google has said for certain, but here’s everything else we’re expecting to see at the launch later this month. \nTriple cameras all around\nThe biggest surprise this year appears to be a move to upgrade the base Pixel 10 to a triple rear camera, including a telephoto lens for the first time, bringing it in line with the three Pro models.\nBut before you get too excited, know that there are some downsides. To offset the added cost — and perhaps to give you a reason to consider the upgrade to the Pro — Google will reportedly downgrade the Pixel 10’s other cameras. \nAndroid Authority reports that Google is using smaller sensors for the Pixel 10’s main camera and ultrawide than the Pixel 9 had, meaning the cameras will capture less light. In fact, it will apparently use the same sensors it did on the Pixel 9A. That means that unless Google has made improvements elsewhere, the Pixel 10’s main and ultrawide cameras will be worse than on the 9, but offset by the addition of the telephoto lens. At least the selfie camera should remain unchanged.\nIt also means the triple cameras on the 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL — which will apparently be unchanged from the 9 Pro models — could be superior to the 10 across the board. The 10 Pro Fold camera will be comparable to the 10’s, using the same sensors for its main and telephoto shooters, and similarly specced ones for the selfie and ultrawide. That represents a very slight upgrade to the main camera in the Fold, but the base 10 is the only model getting a real camera overhaul.\nContrasting colors\nGoogle may also be making unexpected decisions about the phones’ colors, going by allegedly official renders leaked by Android Headlines.\nOn the base Pixel 10 that means brighter colors than ever (and confirmation of that triple camera). The site reports that the phone will come in “Obsidian,” Google’s standard black finish, along with a vibrant blue called “Indigo,” a paler shade called “Frost,” and an almost fluorescent green dubbed “Limoncello.”\nBy contrast, the Pro models look muted. The 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL come in the same “Obsidian” black, plus the returning “Porcelain” white, a soft green called “Jade,” and a gray-blue called “Moonstone.” You might recognize that shade from Google’s official image up at the top.\nStranger are the colors for the 10 Pro Fold. Android Headlines reports that it only comes in two variants, but unlike last year those aren’t black and white. Instead, the Fold will apparently only be available in “Moonstone” and “Jade,” making it the rare phone to not launch in black at all.\nFor more confirmation of those colors, another leaked image from the Play Store shows the full Pixel 10 lineup with the three Pro models all in “Moonstone” and the regular 10 in “Indigo.” Leaker Evan Blass has also shared multiple images of all the phones in two separate collections of leaked images on X.\nQi2 charging\nIn July, the Wireless Power Consortium announced Qi2 25W, a faster version of the magnetic wireless charging standard, and promised support from “major Android smartphones.” We think that means the Pixel 10 line.\nGoogle hasn’t supported Qi2 on its previous Pixels, but there are good reasons to think that might be about to change. \nThe first is that Android Authority reported in June that Google is preparing an ecosystem of magnetic Qi2 accessories under the “Pixelsnap” brand, including two chargers and a stand. This has been followed by later leaks of Pixelsnap cases with rings for magnets, and a recent image of a magnetic charging puck shared by Blass.\nThat latter leak is arguably the most important. While it had previously been thought that Google might follow Samsung in certifying its phones Qi2 Ready, meaning they would support Qi2 charging but not contain the magnets, this image shows a charger attaching magnetically to the phone itself, which implies full Qi2 support, magnets and all.\nFor more evidence of that, we have the size of the new handsets. Android Headlines claims to have the official dimensions and weights of all four phones, and each is heavier than the previous generation, and all but the XL are thicker, too.\nThis could just be because the phones will have bigger batteries, which several reports have suggested. But Google could also be making space for the magnets required to enable Qi2 support.\nThe first IP68 foldable\nOne rumor that’s circulated for a while is that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be the first foldable phone to pack an IP68 rating.\nBy comparison, Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Motorola Razr Ultra both have IP48 ratings. That means they’re protected against objects larger than 1mm, but the 10 Pro Fold bumps that up to complete protection against dust and particulates — the highest possible rating for dust protection on the IP scale — while maintaining a high water-resistance rating too.\nSo far, no foldable phone has achieved that level of dust and particle protection, whether sold in the US or otherwise, suggesting that this has involved a pretty impressive feat of engineering on Google’s part to protect the phone’s delicate mechanisms entirely.\nChip upgrades\nBoring, I know — every phone, every year, has a chipset upgrade. But we are expecting more from Google this time around.\nAndroid Authority has repeatedly reported that for the new Tensor G5 chip Google is moving manufacturing from Samsung to TSMC, using the same 3nm N3E process Apple uses for the iPhone 16 Pro’s A18 Pro chip. Together with some tweaks to the core layout, that’s expected to produce a significant boost in processing power, closing the gap between Pixels and the competition.\nAI everywhere\nAndroid Authority reports that Google is developing several new AI imaging features, though some may be for next year’s Pixel 11. “Sketch-to-Image” will be the Pixel version of a feature already seen on Samsung phones, while “Speak-to-Tweak” should be a voice-based photo editing tool. The latter has more recently been reported by Android Headlines, which claims you’ll be able to use voice prompts for simple edits like “changing backgrounds, brightening images, or removing objects.”\nAndroid Headlines reports that a new AI feature called “Camera Coach” will use Gemini to advise you as you’re taking shots, giving advice on adjusting camera angles or lighting to get a better photo before you take it.\nAndroid Authority has also reported that the Pixel 10 will have a new virtual assistant called “Pixel Sense,” once rumored to be called “Pixie.” Pixel Sense will reportedly use information from other Google apps to complete tasks across your phone, make predictive suggestions to help you before you ask, and better learn your tastes from all that data. Impressively, that will all be processed on-device.\nIt sounds like a more powerful version of the multimodal actions Google added to Gemini in January, but going by the name, it sounds like a Pixel exclusive.\nThese AI features should arrive alongside Android updates we’ve known about since Google I/O, like the big Material 3 Expressive redesign and a desktop mode based on Samsung’s DeX.\nFamiliar prices and a late Fold\nIf you’re worried that it sounds like Google hasn’t made many outright hardware upgrades this year, you may be reassured by news that they’re probably not changing their prices either. A leak from Android Headlines includes the alleged US pricing for all four phones, and it’s almost identical to last year’s. \nPer rumors, the Pixel 10 will start at $799 for 128GB of storage, or $899 for 256GB. The 10 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB, rising all the way up to $1,449 for a 1TB option.\nThe two larger phones could be the only models with price changes. The 10 Pro XL may see a price bump from $1,099 to $1,199, but that’s only because Google has scrapped the phone’s 128GB option, starting at 256GB instead — and matching the 9 Pro XL’s pricing at that and higher storage tiers.\nMeanwhile, the 10 Pro Fold may stick with a $1,799 starting price for 256GB of storage, but the leak suggests Google is adding a new 1TB option at $2,149.\nThe Fold may also go on sale separately from the other phones. A report from WinFuture, since echoed by Evan Blass, claims that due to “supply chain problems,” the Fold won’t go on sale until October 9th. The Pixel Watch 4 and Buds 2A will reportedly be late too, while the other three phones could hit stores on August 28th.\nUpdate, August 14th: Added new Google ad revealing the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, a link to a recent leak of Pixelsnap phone cases, and rumors of an IP68 rating for the Fold.",

      "raw": "The step-through Cruiser ST model at the heart of the recall. | Image: Cowboy\t\n\nAfter months of speculation over the e-bike maker’s imminent demise, Cowboy says it now has the financial backing it needs to survive. The Brussels-based maker of boutique e-bikes says it has secured short-term financing to keep the lights on and a commitment from Rebirth Group Holding that should “ensure its long-term future.” \nThe bicycle company that once swore it wouldn’t become the next VanMoof, recently showed signs of following a similar path to bankruptcy. New e-bike deliveries were taking months, repairs were delayed due to a lack of parts, payments were missed, and debt was mounting, according to media reports and customer complaints.\nCowboy already had a relationship with Rebirth Group prior to signing a term sheet with its new partner. Rebirth is the parent of Re-cycles, the French manufacturer of traditional bicycles that recently took over responsibility for Cowboy’s e-bike assembly operations. The move was supposed to reduce delivery times and improve customer support over time, but it also contributed to some short-term issues during the transition out of Hungary. Today’s announcement makes Rebirth Group doubly vested in Cowboy’s survival.\nCowboy says a costly recall of its Cruiser ST that followed a post-covid bikeaggedon — which continues to rile the e-bike industry — created “the most challenging period in the company’s history.” The recall, according to Cowboy, was caused by an “unapproved change from a supplier.”\nWith funding secured, replacement frames ready, and the first recall hub up and operational (with more cities to come), Cowboy says that operations and production will gradually return to normal.\n“Our priority is to restore normal operations before year-end, working closely with our new partner,” says Cowboy in a press release. “This means delivering outstanding bikes, resolving open cases, and regaining the level of service our customers expect.”\nCowboy says it will provide updated progress in September.",

Calls to embrace natural beauty resonated across Asia and much of the global south, directly challenging the colonial belief that lighter skin conferred greater worth.\nUkraine | Donald Trump told European leaders on Wednesday he would be seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine at his summit with Vladimir Putin on Friday and gave reassurances that he would not make any territorial concessions without Kyiv’s full involvement.\nUK news | David Lammy has referred himself to the environment watchdog after going fishing with JD Vance without the required licence during the US vice-president’s trip to the UK.\nImmigration | At least 20 people have died after a boat capsized off the southern Italian island of Lampedusa, a United Nations agency and local media reported on Wednesday.\nUK politics | Keir Starmer is to formally revive Northern Powerhouse Rail this autumn with an announcement expected before the Labour conference.\nPalestine | The United Nations special rapporteur for the occupied territories has warned that moves to recognise a Palestinian state should not distract member states from stopping mass death and starvation in Gaza.\n Continue reading...",

To fund the repayment, we plan to draw on the approximately $300 million in cash we expect to receive from the reversion and settlement of our U.S. pension fund (the Kodak Retirement Income Plan, or “KRIP”) in December. However, the KRIP reversion is not solely within Kodak’s control and therefore is not deemed “probable” under U.S. GAAP accounting rules, which is what triggered the “going concern.” Once the KRIP reversion is completed Kodak will be virtually net debt free and will have a stronger balance sheet than we have had in years.”",

      "raw": "Apple is developing a bunch of products and features to deliver its vision of AI, including multiple robots, a smart home display, and a revamped version of Siri with new technology powering it, according to an extensive report from Bloomberg. The company’s generative AI efforts lag those from other big tech companies, and  it delayed some upgrades to Siri earlier this year, but these rumored new initiatives point to  the smart home as a key place for its AI technology\nOne of the robots is apparently a tabletop robot that “resembles” an iPad mounted to an arm that can move around and follow users as they move around a room, Bloomberg says. Apple has already shared a preview of what this could look like: earlier this year, the company published research showing a tabletop robot that looks like a real-life version of the Pixar logo with a lamp on the end of the arm. In videos, it’s quite charming — it can even dance. \nA key part of the device, which Apple is aiming to launch in 2027, would be a more visual version of Siri that users could have more natural conversations with, like what’s possible with ChatGPT’s voice mode. Bloomberg says Apple has tested using an animated take on the Finder logo for Siri, but the company is also apparently thinking about ideas that are more like Memoji. Apple is also revamping Siri so that it’s powered by LLMs.\nApple is working on other robots, too, including an Amazon Astro-like robot that has wheels, and it has “loosely discussed” humanoid robots, according to Bloomberg.\nBy the “middle of next year,” Apple plans to launch a smart home display that will let you do things like control your smart home, play music, take notes, and do video calls, Bloomberg says, and this device could have the new look for Siri. The display and the tabletop robot may have a new OS that can be used by multiple people, and could be able to personalize what’s shown to a user by scanning their face with a front-facing camera. Bloomberg says the smart home screen resembles a Google Nest Hub but has a square display.\nIn addition to the smart home display, Apple is also working on a security camera, and it plans to develop “multiple types of cameras and home-security products as part of an entirely new hardware and software lineup,” Bloomberg says.",
