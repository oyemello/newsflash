      "raw": "The team working on the next BioShock game is losing a third of its staff. According to Bloomberg, Take-Two is laying off more than 80 people at Cloud Chamber, which has been working on a new BioShock title, and the game has been delayed from a planned launch in late 2026 or early 2027.\nThe game has already had a rocky development, and the changes likely mean that the new title may still be years away. The last game in the series, BioShock Infinite, was released in 2013.\nTo help get this new entry back on track, 2K Games, the division of Take-Two that oversees Cloud Chamber, has hired Rod Fergusson, formerly the head of the Diablo team at Blizzard and helped get BioShock Infinite over the finish line, to lead the Cloud Chamber team. “I’m deeply grateful for the work the studio has done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love,” Fergusson wrote yesterday.\nIn an internal memo announcing the Cloud Chamber layoffs, 2K Games president David Ismailer said that “while we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” per a memo published by Variety.\nTake-Two didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from The Verge.",

      "raw": "Things just keep going wrong for Analogue’s take on the Nintendo 64. The company announced today that the shipping date for its next console, the Analogue 3D, has been delayed until sometime in Q4 of this year. The announcement comes a little over a month after the console’s previous delay, which would’ve seen it ship at the end of August.\nWhile the July announcement cited the ongoing mess around tariffs as the reason for that delay, the cause for the current delay is less clear.\n“Analogue has been moving at maximum pace, processing shipping to everyone who has been patiently waiting,” the company wrote in a statement. “Unexpected, uncommon issues are rare. Especially in a negligible degree under esoteric circumstances. We’re ensuring every detail meets our standard.” The statement added that the launch is “at 99% percent. Hardware, system, packaging — the full kit — been set for months. The last one percent is where we’re focused.”\nThe company also says that the currently vague Q4 timing is “intentionally set conservatively,” presumably to avoid having to announce another delay. Full refunds are available for those who pre-ordered.\nThe Analogue 3D was first announced in 2023 with plans to launch the following year, and was delayed multiple times since then. The 3D — which promises to render N64 games in 4K and boasts 100 percent compatibility with the console’s library — is the latest project from the company, which has previously made high-end versions of the NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy.",

      "raw": "The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition boasts a vibrant color mode. | Image: The Verge\t\n\nWhen it comes to finding a device to read ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on X or Bluesky. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.\n \n\nThe best Kindle (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition deals\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Kids deals\n\nAmazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the Kindle Scribe, Amazon is moving beyond books and into the realm of writing — something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.\nBelow, we’ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes there isn’t a deal for one or even any of the products, but in those cases, we’ve listed the most recent sale price. \nThe best Kindle (2024) deals\nWhat does it mean when a Kindle is “ad-supported”?\nAmazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.\nIn case you missed it, Amazon announced a new entry-level Kindle in October of last year, one that was designed to replace the outgoing 2022 model. The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.\nIn the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, however, you can only buy the base Kindle at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its full retail price of $109.99.\nKindle (2024)\nAmazon’s new entry-level Kindle retains a six-inch, 300ppi display and USB-C. It’s both brighter and faster than its predecessor, however, and features longer battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $109.99 at Amazon\n $109.99 at Best Buy\n $109.99 at Target\n\nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\nAmazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The new Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.\nIn terms of add-ons, the newest Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The last feature is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series — at no additional cost.\nPreviously, we’ve seen the latest Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off). Right now, however, you can only pick it up at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target at its full price of $129.99.\nKindle Kids (2024)\nAmazon’s Kindle Kids is identical to the standard Kindle — meaning it packs a 300ppi display and support for USB-C charging — but comes with a case, an extended two-year warranty, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129.99 at Amazon\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n $129.99 at Target\n\n\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\nThe latest Kindle Paperwhite, which launched last year, is Amazon’s 12th-gen model. Considering it’s one of the company’s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. It’s noticeably faster than Amazon’s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life.\nDuring events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we’ve seen the standard Paperwhite drop to as low as $129.99. Sadly, the standalone model is currently only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $159.99 (its full retail price). If you’re okay with purchasing a bundle, you can grab it at Amazon with a power adapter and either a green, pink, or black fabric cover for $196.97 ($20 off); it’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in green, pink, or black for $202.97 (also $20 off).\nRead our Kindle Paperwhite (2024) review.\nKindle Paperwhite (2024)\nAmazon’s latest Paperwhite features a larger seven-inch display and noticeably faster performance. It also boasts longer battery life than the previous model, retains IPX8 waterproofing, and includes a USB-C port. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159.99 at Amazon (ad-supported)\n $159.99 at Best Buy (ad-supported)\n $159.99 at Target (ad-supported)\n\n\n2024 Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle (with ads)\nThe seven-inch Kindle Paperwhite features a larger display and faster performance than Amazon’s entry-level ebook reader. You can also buy it in a bundle with a cover and a USB-C charger. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $216.97 $196.97 at Amazon (fabric cover)\n $222.97 $202.97 at Amazon (leather cover)\n\nLike other Kindles, the new Paperwhite is available in a few different configurations — including an ad-free Signature Edition that’s identical to the standard model but comes with 32GB of storage, Qi wireless charging, and a backlight that will automatically adjust when needed. \nIn the past, the Signature Edition has been discounted to $149.99 ($50 off). Currently, however, it is only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its usual price of $199.99. You can also pick it up at Amazon with a wireless charging dock and a black, green, or pink fabric cover starting at $251.97 ($25 off). It’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in black, green, or pink for $257.97 ($25 off).\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (2024)\nThe premium Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition offers the same design and performance as the standard model but with more storage and support for wireless charging.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $199.99 at Amazon\n $199.99 at Best Buy \n $199.99 at Target\n\n\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition Essentials Bundle\nAmazon’s step-up Kindle Paperwhite bundle includes a Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, a wireless charging dock, and your choice of either a fabric or plant-based cover.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $276.97 $251.97 at Amazon (fabric cover)\n $282.97 $257.97 at Amazon (leather cover)\n\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals\nAmazon also rolled out a Kindle Paperwhite Kids for $179.99 in 2024. It’s identical to the standard Kindle Paperwhite, with the same waterproof design and sharp, seven-inch display. However, like the Kindle Kids, the e-reader is free of ads and offers optional parental controls. It also comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.\nAlthough the Kindle Paperwhite Kids has been known to occasionally drop to $129.99 ($50 off) during special sales events, it’s currently only available for its usual price of $179.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.\nKindle Paperwhite Kids (2024)\nAmazon’s kid-friendly Paperwhite is the same as the standard Paperwhite, but it’s ad-free and comes with the added benefits of a two-year hardware protection plan, six months of Amazon Kids Plus, and a choice of three kid-friendly covers. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 at Amazon\n $179.99 at Best Buy\n $179.99 at Target\n\n\nThe best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals\nLike its predecessor, the second-gen Kindle Scribe is Amazon’s biggest e-reader. It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300ppi resolution, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles are known. What separates the Scribe from other Kindles, however, is that it comes with a stylus, which can be used to jot down notes or doodle in the ebook reader’s built-in notebook. With the latest Scribe, Amazon also introduced a new Active Canvas feature, so you can scribble notes directly on ebook pages, as well as a suite of AI-powered features that can summarize your notes and refine your handwriting.\nAlthough we recently saw the standard Kindle Scribe go for an impressive $259.99 ($140 off), it’s currently only available for its usual $399.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. You can also pick up the base Scribe at Amazon as a part of a bundle with a 9W power adapter, a Premium Pen, and either a plant-based leather cover starting at $444.97 ($55 off) or a “premium” leather cover starting at $459.97 ($60 off). Alternatively, the 64GB version is available at Amazon with the same accessories and a premium leather cover for $504.97 ($65 off).\nRead our Kindle Scribe (2024) review.\nKindle Scribe (2024)\nThe latest Kindle Scribe is a 10.2-inch e-reader with a stylus for taking notes. It’s faster than its predecessor and offers a host of new features, including one that lets you jot notes directly in your book.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 at Amazon (16GB)\n $399.99 at Best Buy (16GB)\n $449.99 at Amazon (64GB)\n\n\nKindle Scribe Essentials Bundle\nAmazon’s base Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle comes with a 16GB Kindle Scribe, a Premium Pen, a power adapter, and a cover in the color of your choice.\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $489.97 $444.97 at Amazon (with plant-based leather cover)\n $519.97 $459.97 at Amazon (with premium leather cover)\n\n\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition deals\nIn October, Amazon announced its first color e-reader, the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition. Like the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, it boasts a seven-inch display with a crisp 300ppi resolution, IPX8 water resistance, wireless charging, and 32GB of storage. However, unlike the Paperwhite, the e-reader offers a color mode, which cuts the resolution in half. Thankfully, it’s still vibrant for a color E-Ink screen despite the lower resolution, rendering it particularly ideal for reading comic books and manga.\nMore recently, Amazon introduced a cheaper Colorsoft, one that retails for $249.99 and comes with only 16GB of storage. It lacks wireless charging and an auto-adjusting front light, but it’s otherwise identical to the first-gen model. \nThe 16GB model has yet to receive a discount, and while the 32GB Signature Edition has gone on sale for as low as $179.99 (100 off) previously, it can now only be found at its usual $279.99 price at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. However, you can save some money at Amazon if you buy it as a part of a bundle for $327.97 ($53 off), which nets you a wireless charging dock and plant-based leather cover in black, pink, or green. If you want a more premium experience, Amazon even sells it with a leather cover in red or black for $349.97 ($35 off).\nRead our Kindle Colorsoft review.\nKindle Colorsoft Signature Edition\nThe Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is Amazon’s first e-reader with a color display.

The ad-free ebook reader also comes with one of two covers, a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids Plus, an extended two-year warranty, and optional parental controls.\nGiven how recently it launched, there are currently no deals available on the Colorsoft Kids; however, you can still buy it at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its full retail price of $269.99.\nKindle Colorsoft Kids\nLike the standard model, Amazon’s kid-friendly Colorsoft comes with a seven-inch color display and waterproofing.

Right now, you can pick up the brand’s first pair of over-the-ear headphones for an all-time low price of $269 ($30 off) at Amazon and Nothing’s online storefront.\nWhat makes the Headphone 1 unique is their retro-transparent design that Nothing introduced with the Phone 1. Similar to other high-end headphones, they support features like active noise cancellation, spatial audio with head tracking, and comfortable ear pads. In our review, The Verge’s Andru Marino said they were comfortable during extended use, surpassing even the premium Sony WH-1000XM6. Speaking of extended use, the headphones deliver great battery life, lasting days with continuous listening during our testing.\nNothing Headphone 1\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 $269 at Amazon\n $299 $269 at Nothing\n\nBeyond comfort, one of the standout features of the Headphone 1 is the button design. You can control the volume, play and pause audio, and switch between listening modes (noise canceling, transparency, or off) with a roller located on the right ear cup. A paddle button allows you to skip tracks, fast forward or rewind, or hang up or decline calls when held down. There’s also a customizable button on the outside of the right ear cup that can be set to launch a voice assistant like Google Gemini, mute the microphone, or enable spatial audio.\nThe market of really good noise-canceling headphones is more competitive than ever right now, but the Headphone 1 manage to carve out a niche thanks to its set of high-end features and unique design. If that’s something you’re looking for — and you want to save some money — the Headphone 1 are a solid option.\nMore deals worth checking out\nInsta360’s Link 2 is back down to its all-time low of $149.99 ($50 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Insta360’s online storefront through September 1st. The webcam offers sharp, detailed 4K video at 30fps and a motorized three-axis gimbal, which can automatically keep you centered in the frame during video calls. It supports group tracking, too, making it a great tool for presentations. You can also control the Link 2 from your phone, add filters, blur the background, and change between single tracking and group tracking modes.\nThe Garmin Forerunner 970 is the brand’s latest top-of-the-line smartwatch for avid runners, and it’s currently at an all-time low of $699.99 ($50 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. The watch features a larger 47mm case, offers offline maps, and supports three new metrics, including running tolerance, running economy, and step speed loss. Additionally, Garmin says the Forerunner 970 gets up to 15 days of battery life — more than enough to last an ultramarathon.\nAnker’s 200W 6-Port Prime Charger is currently at an all-time low of $55.99 ($24 off) at Amazon and Anker (with code WS7DV2EUISAO). The desktop charging station helps eliminate clutter by providing an output of up to 200W across six ports, including four USB-C and two USB-A. You can charge a single USB-C device at an output of up to 100W, or you can charge six devices simultaneously, including a laptop, tablet, phone, and more. You can even use it to charge two 14-inch MacBook Pros from 0 to 50 percent in less than 30 minutes.",

      "raw": "Google has officially announced the Pixel 10 lineup, and there’s a lot to dig into. Like last year, there are four devices — the Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pro, the Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold — and the phones have some nice improvements and new features that might be worth the upgrade.\nHere are some of the best new features for Google’s new phones.\nThey have built-in Pixelsnap magnets and support Qi2 wireless charging\nGoogle is finally catching up with Apple by building magnets directly into the Pixel 10 series to help make sure the phones snap right onto a wireless charger. The company is branding this as “Pixelsnap,” and it will sell Pixelsnap accessories like an official charger that you can buy. The Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro Fold are all Qi2-certified, meaning they support wireless charging speeds of up to 15W, while the 10 Pro XL is Qi2.2-certified, so it supports wireless charging speeds of up to 25W. (The Pixel 10 lineup has faster wired charging speeds as well.)\nThe base Pixel now has a third rear camera\nGoogle is adding a third camera to the Pixel 10: a 5x telephoto lens that it says offers “10x optical image quality” and “Super Res Zoom up to 20x.” However, while it’s nice that Google is no longer forcing you to buy one of its more expensive options just to get a telephoto lens, the Pixel 10’s main and ultrawide cameras are a slight downgrade from the Pixel 9, at least on paper. The Pixel 10 has a 48MP main camera and a 13MP ultrawide camera, down from the Pixel 9’s 50MP main camera and 48MP ultrawide.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold gets a big durability boost\nGoogle’s newest foldable has an IP68 dust and water ingress rating, meaning that it’s significantly more resistant to dust than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and many other foldables. That 6 in the rating means the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is “dust-tight,” which is a big improvement over the IPX8 rating for the previous-generation Fold and a step up from the IP48 rating for Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nYes, there are some new AI-focused tools\nThe company is obsessed with AI lately, and although that obsession has seeped into its phones, it seems like the Pixel 10 series could have some useful AI tricks. One feature, Magic Cue, can proactively suggest things as you’re on your phone, like pulling up flight information when you’re calling an airline. Another feature, Camera Coach, can give you nudges about ways to improve the photo you’re trying to take.",

      "raw": "Google’s latest Pixel lineup starts at $799.\t\n\nGoogle announced its entire Pixel 10 generation of phones at a jam-packed Made for Google event this week. The familiar four-phone lineup includes the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. All of them have received processor bumps and other technical improvements, along with a commitment by Google to provide seven years of operating system updates. Naturally, there are some new AI features, too. \nThe Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL start at $799, $999, and $1,199, respectively, and begin shipping on August 28th. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold, meanwhile, starts at $1,799 and launches on October 9th. If you’re confused about what makes each phone tick or which to choose, we’ve broken everything down, along with preorder information if you decide to pick one up.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere to preorder the Google Pixel 10 \nWhere to preorder the Google Pixel 10 Pro\nWhere to preorder the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL\nWhere to preorder the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold\nUS carrier deals and incentives \n\nWhere to preorder the Google Pixel 10 \nThe new Pixel 10 is Google’s latest entry-level flagship smartphone. It has 6.3-inch 120Hz OLED display, Google’s new Tensor G5 processor, a battery that can supposedly last more than 30 hours, and a three-lens rear camera system that consists of a 48-megapixel wide, a 13-megapixel ultrawide, and a 10.8-megapixel telephoto lens. The phone comes in two storage tiers, 128GB or 256GB, and both have 12GB of RAM.\nGoogle says its G5 processor is 60 percent more powerful than the G4 for on-device AI tasks, and is 34 percent faster overall. The phone also supports Pixelsnap, a new Qi2-certified wireless charging feature. If you prefer wired charging, Google says you can charge its battery from 0 to 55 percent in about 30 minutes using a 30W USB-C power adapter.\nThe Pixel 10 begins shipping on August 28th, and you can preorder the 128GB model at Amazon, Best Buy, or directly from the Google Store for $799. The 256GB model costs $899. All three retailers are offering a $100 gift card when you purchase the Pixel 10 in either storage tier. \nGoogle Pixel 10 (128GB)\nGoogle’s Pixel 10 has a 6.3-inch OLED display, Google Tensor G5 processor, 12GB of RAM, support for Pixelsnap wireless charging, and a triple-lens camera system including a new 10.8 megapixel telephoto.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $899 $799 at Amazon (with $100 gift card)\n $899 $799 at Best Buy (with $100 gift card)\n $899 $799 at Google (with $100 store credit)\n\nWhere to preorder the Google Pixel 10 Pro\nThe Pixel 10 Pro has the same sized screen and processor as the Pixel 10, but it’s an improvement in almost every other way. Its OLED display has a 1Hz to 120Hz refresh rate, higher maximum brightness, and slightly higher resolution. It supports Wi-Fi 7 (the standard Pixel only supports Wi-Fi 6E) for faster networking, and an Ultra-Wideband chip. Its three-lens camera system includes a 50-megapixel wide, a 48-megapixel ultrawide, and a 48-megapixel telephoto, plus the ability to record 8K video.\nYou also get 16GB of RAM and four storage tiers: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. The Pixel 10 Pro has a slightly smaller battery than the Pixel 10, but Google says its runtime is the same. The Pixel 10 Pro also comes with a 12-month subscription to Google AI Plus (typically $19.99 a month).\nThe Pixel 10 Pro begins shipping on August 28th, and you can preorder the 128GB model at Amazon, Best Buy, or directly from Google starting at $999. The 256GB model costs $1,099, the 512GB model costs $1,219, and the 1TB model costs $1,499. All three retailers are offering a $200 gift card when you purchase the Pixel 10 Pro in any storage tier.\nGoogle Pixel 10 Pro (128GB)\nThe Pixel 10 Pro has a 6.3-inch OLED display, Google’s Tensor G5 processor, 16GB of RAM, Pixelsnap wireless charging at 15W, support for Wi-Fi 7, and an Ultra-Wideband chip.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199 $999 at Amazon (with $200 gift card)\n $1199 $999 at Best Buy (with $200 gift card)\n $1199 $999 at Google (with $200 store credit)\n\nWhere to preorder the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro XL has most of the same specs as Google’s standard Pro phone, including an identical processor and the same RAM, camera system, and support for Wi-Fi 7. That being said, it sports a 6.8-inch OLED screen, as opposed to a 6.3-inch display. The phone’s bigger display and larger battery cancel one another out, so Google says you get the same battery life.\nIt has the same amount of memory and storage as the standard Google Pixel Pro, too; however, its Pixelsnap charging feature is Qi2.2-certified at speeds up to 25W. If you prefer wired charging, Google says you can charge the 10 Pro XL’s battery from 0 to 70 percent in roughly half an hour using a 45W USB-C power adapter. It’s only available in three storage sizes — 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB — and includes a 12-month subscription to Google’s AI Plus service.\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is slated to arrive on August 28th, and you can preorder the 256GB model at Amazon, Best Buy, or the Google Store starting at $1,199. The 512GB model costs $1,319 and the 1TB model costs $1,549. All three retailers are offering a $200 gift card when you purchase the Pixel 10 Pro XL in any storage tier.\nGoogle Pixel 10 Pro XL (256GB)\nThe Pixel 10 Pro XL is largest non-foldable smartphone. It has a 6.8-inch OLED screen, Google’s Tensor G5 chip, and support for Pixelsnap wireless charging at up to 25W. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1399 $1199 at Amazon (with $200 gift card)\n $1399 $1199 at Best Buy (with $200 gift card)\n $1399 $1199 at Google (with $200 store credit)\n\nWhere to preorder the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold\nGoogle’s third-gen foldable has the same processor, RAM, maximum brightness, and battery life as its other Pro phones, but there are some key differences. When folded, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold leverages a 6.4-inch 60Hz to 120Hz OLED display. When you open it up, it showcases an 8-inch OLED screen with a refresh rate of 1Hz to 120Hz.\nIts three-lens rear camera system comprises a 48-megapixel wide, a 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, and a 10.8-megapixel telephoto, with the ability to record 4K video. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold also carries an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance — which is impressive for a foldable phone — and comes with a 12-month subscription to Google’s AI Plus service, just like the aforementioned 10 Pro XL.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold begins shipping on October 9th, and you can preorder the entry-level 256GB model at Amazon, Best Buy, or directly from Google starting at $1,799. The 512GB model costs $1,919, and the 1TB model costs $2,149. Amazon is offering a $300 gift card when you purchase the Pixel 10 Pro Fold in any storage tier. You can get a $350 gift card with purchase at Best Buy and from Google.\nGoogle Pixel Pro 10 Fold (256GB)\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold has a 6.4-inch outer screen and eight-inch inner screen. The new foldable has Google’s Tensor G5 processor, 16GB of RAM, Wi-Fi 7 support, Pixelsnap wireless charging at 15W, and an IP68 rating.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2099 $1799 at Amazon (with $300 gift card)\n $2150 $1799 at Best Buy (with $350 gift card)\n $2150 $1799 at Google (with $350 gift card)\n\nUS carrier deals and incentives \nIf you don’t want to pay for your entire phone up front, several US carriers are currently offering deals if you purchase or upgrade through them. Be mindful that taking advantage of these deals will lock your phone to that carrier, and likely mean you’ll end up breaking up your purchase into monthly payments that’ll increase your monthly bill. These deals are available online, but you may also be able to take advantage of them in-store.\nVerizon is offering new and existing customers an Unlimited Upgrade plan that can get them a Pixel 10 Pro with 256GB of storage “for free” when they trade in a Google, Apple, Motorola, or Samsung phone in any condition. Alternatively, subscribers can choose to get $1,000 toward a Pixel Pro Fold 10 with 256GB of storage when trading in the qualifying phones from the same manufacturers, including an iPhone 11 or newer, Samsung Galaxy S20 to the Galaxy Z Fold6, Pixel 4a or newer, or an original Moto Razr or the 2025 Moto razr. Unlimited Ultimate and Unlimited Plus subscribers can also get six months of Google AI Pro for free with the purchase of any Pixel 10 series phone, after which they’ll pay $9.99 per month (normally $19.99) to continue their subscription.\nT-Mobile is offering new and existing customers who open up a new line a “free” Pixel 10 with 128GB of storage when you activate a new line on an eligible Essentials or other qualifying plan via $800 in bill credits over 24 months.
