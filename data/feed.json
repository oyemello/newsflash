      "raw": "I may show up for the Superstrike, not for the rapid trigger, but for this panda color scheme. | Image: Logitech\t\n\nLogitech’s next flagship wireless gaming mouse is ditching mechanical switches for an analog system equipped with haptics actuators to simulate the feeling of a click. The mouse is called the Pro X2 Superstrike, and it’s coming early next year for $179.99.\nThe inductive analog system (which Logitech calls Haptic Inductive Trigger System, or HITS) boasts a small 0.6mm travel per main button. They’re supposed to let players click faster than ever thanks to their low latency — Logitech claims it improves latency by up to 30 milliseconds — plus 10 customizable actuation points, and rapid trigger support.\nRapid trigger is more commonly found in gaming keyboards, but now it’s coming to mice. The simple explanation is that it allows the sensor to reset when you barely lift up on the button, letting it quickly register another input with minimal force. It allows you take action faster than those using mice that lack rapid trigger. This mouse supports five rapid trigger reset points, configurable via G Hub, letting you get super granular with when you want the analog sensor to reset.\nThe Superstrike weighs 65 grams, and features Logitech’s Hero 2 sensor, which is also present in its current lineup of Pro X wireless gaming mice. It supports up to an 8,000Hz polling rate wirelessly via its included Lightspeed USB-A dongle, although it’s only accessible via the G Hub software. I’m generally skeptical of 8,000Hz polling rates since most people’s reaction time isn’t fast enough to warrant it, but I’m curious if it’ll make a noticeable difference in conjunction with the Superstrike’s rapid trigger functionality.\nLogitech is also announcing the Superlight 2C, a more compact version of the Superlight 2 mouse. It’s 10 percent lighter at 51 grams and five percent smaller overall, which could make it a preferred choice among PC gamers whose hands don’t jibe with the size of most gaming mice. Other than its shape, its specs seem identical to the Superlight 2. It’ll be available on October 21st for $159.99.",

A full 50 percent of respondents said they were more concerned than excited about the use of AI in their daily lives. That’s down ever so slightly from 52 percent in 2023, but it’s up significantly from 37 percent in 2021. \nAmericans expressed a number of concerns about AI, chief among them that it will negatively impact our ability to think creatively and form meaningful relationships with other people. Just 18 percent believed that AI should play any role at all in dating and matchmaking, with just 3 percent being comfortable with it playing a “big role.” The theme in general was that Americans are okay with AI performing analysis on large data to, say, predict the weather, or find cures for disease, but they wanted it to stay out of their personal lives. Two-thirds of people want it to stay out of their love lives entirely, and 73 percent believe it has no place advising people on their religious beliefs.\nAnother concern was the spread of misinformation. 18 percent of respondents rated misinformation as their number one concern, behind only its negative impact on human abilities and connections. Americans felt that it was very important to be able to identify AI-generated work, but 53 percent said they were not confident in their ability to do so.\nInterestingly, in a reversal of what you’d expect with the emergence of new technologies, it’s actually younger Americans who are more concerned. 57 percent of those under 30 said they were extremely concerned that AI would erode people’s abilities, while only 46 percent of those over 65 said the same.\nBroadly, though, it’s clear that Americans are taking a skeptical eye towards AI. 61 percent said they wanted more control over how AI is used in their daily lives. Unfortunately, 57 percent believe they have little or no control over that.",

It launches October 8th for $179.99.\nThe A20 X ships with a transmitter called the Playsync Base that can receive audio inputs via USB from two platforms. When you press the button on the back of the headset’s right ear cup, a subtle LED light on the transmitter will jump between sources, lit to indicate where your audio is currently coming from.\nThe execution here isn’t too different from what I’ve seen in other — typically pricier — gaming headsets, namely some of Astro’s own. The $399 A50 X and $299 A50 Gen 5 both allow easy audio switching for two consoles (the A50 X also includes video switching via two HDMI-in ports), as do SteelSeries’ $300-ish Arctis Nova Pro Wireless and its $180-ish wired counterpart. All of these solutions make it so you don’t have to leave your chair to swap audio sources. This one just so happens to be the most affordable wireless option that I’ve seen that supports Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC in one model, even if $179.99 still isn’t cheap.\nThe A20 X has other hardware staples we expect to see, like a dedicated two-button rocker for adjusting the game and chat audio (it’s on the opposite ear cup from the volume rocker, so as to avoid confusion). It has a flexible, detachable boom microphone, a mute button, and Bluetooth 5.3 compatibility with phones and other mobile devices. However, its Bluetooth support doesn’t include concurrent wireless connections; it’s one or the other.",

      "raw": "Razer’s Blade 16 gaming laptop with an Nvidia RTX 5060 GPU is on sale for $1,899 ($400 off). | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\t\n\nIf you want a great laptop, you’re going to have to fork over a ton of money, right? Not necessarily. There are dozens of good laptops on the market at various price points. However, it can feel overwhelming to find the right one for your needs (some are better suited for, say, college students, whereas others are ideal for gamers).\nThat’s why we’ve come up with this list of some of the best laptop deals available right now. In addition to the latest discounts, we’ll share each discounted model’s best features (and downsides) to give you more clarity during your shopping journey. And if you need to do more research, you can also check out our guides to the best laptops on the market and the top gaming laptops.\nThe best laptop deals\nApple MacBook deals\nM1 MacBook Air\n2020 MacBook Air with M1 (256GB)\nThe 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold).\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $649 $599 at Walmart\n\nApple itself no longer sells the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1 — and hasn’t for years — but you can still get this solid laptop for $599.99 ($50 off) at Walmart. The 2020 model is available in one configuration, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but it’s still capable at handling basic tasks like a champ, including streaming video, browsing, and dealing with documents. You can also use the M1 MacBook Air for creative work in Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Logic, and Pixelmator, though you may experience slowdown due to its low 8GB of memory.\nThe laptop’s battery lasted between eight and ten hours when we originally reviewed it, and those figures should be mostly accurate, barring some differences likely caused by operating system updates. In addition to offering great performance for its price, the laptop also comes with other nice-to-have features, including a comfortable keyboard and an excellent trackpad. Just note its 720p webcam isn’t particularly good, so if a high-resolution webcam matters a lot to you, you may want to buy one separately. Also, be aware that, due to the limitations of the M1 chip, you can only use one external display at a time and port selection is also more limited than newer models.\nM2 MacBook Air\n13-inch MacBook Air with M2 (2022)\nThe 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $699 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n\nApple’s 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip is a significant leap above the M1 model it succeeded, both in terms of design and performance. The old wedge-shaped look was replaced for a more squared-off design that’s still used by the current-generation MacBook Air. It has a 1080p webcam, which was a welcome improvement given the disappointing camera on the 2020 M1 model. It’s also much lighter and thus more portable as well, yet it retains features like MagSafe charging and Touch ID, as well as a nice display.\nDespite its age, the M2 processor inside of this machine is still powerful enough to handle many tasks, from common ones such as browsing to more complex and creative projects. Compared to newer, pricier models, this one unsurprisingly struggles with gaming. That being said, it’s capable of running Cyberpunk 2077. The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 launched with 8GB of RAM, but that configuration became unavailable last year when Apple made 16GB the new standard. \nWhile a well-rounded laptop overall, there is one key area where Apple’s M1 model is better: storage. The base M2 MacBook Air with 256GB of storage is actually slower than its predecessor because it’s stored in a single NAND chip. This was corrected in subsequent MacBook Air models, so the slowdown is unique to M2 machines with 256GB of storage. Also, be aware as well that port selection isn’t great, and the included display notch — which is also found on both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros — can make using the menu bar more challenging until you get used to it. If that doesn’t bother you, however, you can get a configuration with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, an 8-core CPU and GPU for $699 ($100 off) at Best Buy. Alternatively, you can get a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU for $1,039.99 ($259 off) at Best Buy. If you need more storage, a 15-inch MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU for $1,199.99 ($298 off) at Best Buy.\nM4 MacBook Air\n13-inch Apple MacBook Air 13 (2025, M4)\nThe M4 MacBook Air has a speedy processor, and double the RAM of previous models. It has a thin and light design, all day battery life, and still starts with 256GB of storage. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 $799.99 at Amazon\n\nThe 13-inch MacBook Air with M4 is Apple’s latest thin and lightweight laptop, and it’s our top pick in The Verge’s guide to the best laptops right now. It’s not a MacBook Pro, but Apple’s M4 processor in the Air is still mighty capable. In our tests, it only throttled under heavy load from creative applications, which is understandable given its fanless design. The machine comes with 16GB of RAM as standard rather than an optional upgrade, but the base configuration still comes with just 256GB of storage, so be mindful of that limitation if you work with a lot of larger files. \nApple hasn’t increased the number of ports on a MacBook Air since reintroducing MagSafe to the M2 model in 2022, but this generation has Thunderbolt 4 ports rather than Thunderbolt 3 for faster file transfer speeds. Another notable addition is the 1080p Center Stage camera from the MacBook Pro, so you’ll stay in frame if you move around on a video call. Battery life should last all day, though your experience will vary depending on how hard you push this machine. \nYou can currently get a configuration of the 13-inch with M4 with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and a 10-core CPU and GPU for $799 at Amazon and Best Buy. If you need a larger screen, you can get the 15-inch MacBook Air with the same specs for $999 ($200 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4\nThe entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — and a 512GB SSD for the same starting price of $1,599. It also gets a third USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port and comes in a space black option.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1299 at Amazon\n $1599 $1299 at Best Buy\n $1599 $1399 at B&H Photo\n\n\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro\nThe 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 12-core / 16-core M4 Pro chip starts with 24GB of RAM — a 6GB increase over the prior generation. It also has a 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, an optional nano-texture display, and a 12-megapixel webcam.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $1799 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $1899 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1999 $1849 at Adorama (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\n\n16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM and offers more computing cores (14 for the CPU and 20 for the GPU) compared to the 14-inch model. It also picks up Thunderbolt 5 ports and a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $2249 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $2249 at B&H Photo (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $2249 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nThe M4 generation MacBook Pros are Apple’s fastest laptops yet. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, and comes equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a MagSafe charging port. It can send video to two external displays simultaneously (the previous generation could only handle one) and has an improved 12-megapixel Center Stage camera with better video quality. \nThe M4 MacBook Pro and M4 MacBook Air run on the same chip, but the Pro’s cooling system is better, so it handles resource-intensive tasks (including games) without throttling as easily. The laptop’s 14.2-inch screen is bright (up to 1,600 nits when viewing HDR content), and supports the P3 color gamut, both of which are important to professionals who rely on color accuracy when editing photos and video. The display has a 120Hz refresh rate, so scrolling through webpages or moving windows around should appear smoother than 60Hz screens. In our stress test, which included editing 33-megapixel RAW images and working with a large photo library in Adobe Lightroom, the laptop ran for 12 hours without kicking up the fans or feeling hot to the touch. \nIf you want even more power, you can jump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro processor. It comes with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, a 12-core CPU, and a 16-core GPU. The M4 Pro MacBook Pro has over twice the memory bandwidth of the base M4 MacBook Pro, so it should perform better across the board. That said, it might be tough to notice the benefits of its extra memory and processing power during casual use, but it will come in handy when you’re pushing the laptop to the limits while video editing or playing games. It has three Thunderbolt 5 ports, and you can use that extra bandwidth with an external SSD with fast transfer speeds, to name an example. You can also get the MacBook Pro with M4 Pro with a 16-inch screen if you’d like to work on a larger display. \nRight now, the 14-inch M4 model with 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD and 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU is $1,299 ($400 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. You can get a 14-inch M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 12-core CPU, and 16-core GPU for $1,799 at Amazon and B&H Photo. The 16-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 14-core CPU, and 20-core GPU is currently on sale for $2,249 ($250 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. \nMicrosoft Surface deals\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition\nThe 13.8-inch Surface Laptop is Microsoft’s closest rival to the MacBook Air, using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chipsets for exceptional battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $888.86 at B&H Photo (X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512 SSD)\n $1399.99 $1019.99 at Amazon Buy (X Elite, 16GB RAM, 512 SSD)\n\nWe chose Microsoft’s 7th Edition Surface Laptop as one of the best laptops you can get because it’s the top Snapdragon Copilot Plus PC we’ve tried yet. The laptop runs on a power-efficient ARM processor that doesn’t skimp on performance. Its 13.8-inch 2,304 x 1,536 120Hz screen supports Dolby Vision HDR (High Dynamic Range) and looks very nice. It has a large, precision haptic trackpad that gives you plenty of room to tap and swipe, an offers satisfying feedback no matter where you press it. \nThe laptop has a pair of USB 4 ports, one USB-A 3.1 Gen 1 port, plus a headphone jack. One of the concerns of using an ARM-based Windows PC has been software compatibility, but this model proves that’s no longer something to be as worried about. It runs Photoshop, and apps compiled for X86 processors work thanks to Microsoft’s Prism emulator. Be sure to check the compatibility of the specific Windows app you rely, though, as there’s still a chance they won’t work as intended. \nEven after our toughest tests, the battery lasted seven hours. That’s with 100 percent screen brightness, after downloading multiple Steam games, attending video calls, and running through multiple projects in Photoshop. Using the laptop with less power-hungry apps, including Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, and Chrome, the laptop used just 30 percent of its battery in seven hours. For the best battery life, you’ll want to stick to using native ARM apps when possible. If you want to make the switch to an ARM-based laptop to get some of the benefits MacBook users have had for years, the 7th Generation Surface Laptop is worth checking out.\nYou can get a 13.8-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop (7th Edition) with a Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD for around $888.86 ($211 off) at B&H Photo. A model with the Snapdragon X Elite processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is on sale for $1,019.99 ($380 off) at Amazon.\nAsus laptop deals\nAsus Zenbook S 16\nAsus Zenbook S 16\nThe Asus Zenbook S 16 features AMD’s Ryzen AI mobile processors. It’s one of the thinnest and lightest 16-inch laptops available and doesn’t cut corners on performance. It’s a mighty machine that can handle all sorts of heavy workloads with ease and grace.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $1399.99 at Asus\n\nWe chose Asus’ Zenbook S 16 as another one of our top recommendations for students, but it’s a solid laptop for anyone who wants a large-screened Windows laptop. In our tests, the 16-inch 120Hz 3K (2,880 x 1,800) OLED display emits vivid colors and excellent contrast. The laptop was more than capable of handling common tasks, including video chats using its 1080p webcam, music streaming, but its graphics and gaming performance is what really sets it apart from laptops in its size and price classes. \nThis machine runs Cyberpunk 2077 at around 77 frames per second with the resolution set to 1080p with AMD’s FSR 2.1 upscaling software turned on. The laptop isn’t designed for gaming, but it’s good to know it’s up to the task if you’re willing to turn down some graphical settings. The Zenbook S 16’s battery lasted 11 hours during our testing. However, the percentage indicator in the Windows taskbar would often fluctuate, making it difficult to pin down exactly how much juice was left. \nYou can get a configuration of the laptop with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor for $1,399.99 ($400 off) from Asus.\nThe best Lenovo laptop deals\nLenovo Yoga Book 9i (2024)\nLenovo Yoga Book 9i (2024)\nThe Lenovo Yoga Book 9i is a dual-screen laptop that can fold and flip into several different modes. A Bluetooth keyboard, mouse, and stylus come with it, along with a keyboard folio that can transform into a laptop stand. It’s the Swiss Army knife of laptops. Read our head-to-head review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1999.99 $1499.99 at Best Buy\n\nA dual-screen laptop is admittedly pretty niche, but we chose Lenovo’s Yoga Book 9i is the best of the bunch in our best laptops guide. It runs on Intel’s Core Ultra 7 155U processor, and comes with 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and integrated Intel UHD graphics chip. Its key feature is the pair of 13.3-inch 60Hz OLED touchscreen displays, which each have a 2880 x 1800 resolution. The screens have a clamshell design and are attached by a hinge, so the Yoga Book 9i looks like a typical laptop when opened.\nYou can use the laptop in a few configurations. In clamshell mode, the bottom screen displays a full-sized virtual keyboard with trackpad to give you a traditional laptop experience. Our experience in this mode was mixed because it’s too easy to accidentally minimize apps, or make typos if you’re used to the tactile feel of a physical keyboard. \nYou can attach the Yoga Book 9i to the included keyboard folio, which props it up and allows you to use both screens independently like a laptop attached to an external monitor (except, in the Yoga Book 9i’s case, they’re built-in). One screen can be folded completely over the other display to use the laptop like a large-screen tablet, or folded partially to prop one screen up if you want to watch a movie at a more comfortable angle. \nDuring our testing, the Yoga Book 9i was difficult to use on a lap with the included Bluetooth keyboard because it would shift around while being used. However, moving apps from one display to another using touch gestures was intuitive thanks to tutorials in the User Center app, which immediately launch upon the first boot. The software also lets you enable and disable gestures, if you find some confusing or unnecessary. Switching from a traditional laptop to a dual-screen model will likely take an adjustment period, so it’s very helpful that Lenovo designed software to help ease you through the transition.\nDespite having two screens, the Yoga Book 9i only weighs 2.95 pounds, which was light enough to carry in a backpack without weighing us down. The keyboard folio adds some bulk, but comes with an attached elastic band to keep the laptop and accessory from getting detached while you travel. If you’re dedicated to the dual-screen lifestyle, or you want to give it a try, the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i is on sale for $1499.99 ($500 off) at Best Buy.\nThe best Razer deals \nRazer Blade 16 (2025, RTX 5090)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2399.99 $1899.99 at Razer (RTX 5060)\n $2799.99 $2199.99 at Razer (RTX 5070)\n $3499.99 at Razer (RTX 5080)\n\nThe Razer Blade 16 is one of our favorite 16-inch gaming laptops, and multiple configurations of the machine are currently on sale. Every 2025 model has a 16-inch OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate and a 2560 x 1600 resolution. From there you can choose a machine with the mix of CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage options that’s right for your budget. However, only two models of the Razer Blade 16 are currently on sale. \nThe first is its entry-level configuration with an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor, Nvidia’s RTX 5060 graphics card with 8GB of video memory, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD, which you can get for $1,899.99 ($500 off) from Razer. For a more powerful option with an RTX 5070 graphics card, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD, that’s $2,199.99 ($600 off) now from Razer. Power differences aside, both laptops are equipped with three USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type A ports, two USB4 ports, a UHS-II SD card reader, HDMI 2.1 port, 3.5mm headphone jack, and proprietary charging port.\nWe tested the highest-end configuration of the laptop, which has an Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU. However, since it’s $4,999 and not currently discounted, we recommend the much more affordable configurations to anyone who wants to play PC games on the go. One of the typical tradeoffs when getting a high-end gaming laptop is thickness and weight, but the Razer Blade 16 is surprisingly slender at 4.6 pounds and .69 inches thick at its thickest point.  \nRazer even managed to fit in a 1080p webcam that looks good and six-speaker audio system into the laptop’s thin chassis. Non-gaming features, like the Razer Blade 16’s large trackpad and keyboard were a cut above what we’d expect from a gaming laptop.\nThe laptop’s battery lasted about an hour and a half playing Cyberpunk 2077 and around two hours when playing Elden Ring, so you’ll be able to play games for a bit without plugging it in. However, we needed to turn down both game’s graphics settings to achieve that longevity. We also tested the Razer Blade 16 for creative tasks, and lightly editing roughly 1,000 images in Adobe Lightroom, which took about an hour and drained 25 percent of the laptop’s battery. Read our review.\nThe best HP laptop deals\nHP Victus 15 (2025, RTX 4050)\nThe Victus 15 is a popular, budget-friendly gaming laptop that now comes with RTX 4050 graphics, more RAM, and an improved 144Hz screen.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1049.99 $699 at Walmart (Intel)\n\nHP’s Victus 15 is our top pick for a budget-friendly gaming laptop, and a good choice if you want a laptop with a little more graphical oomph for well under $1,000 on sale.  It’s powered by an Intel Core i5-1342H processor and has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It has an 144Hz 1080p screen and Nvidia RTX 4050 graphics card with 6GB of dedicated video memory, which shine when playing live service games like Minecraft and Fortnite. You should also be able to play more graphically-demanding games at lower graphics settings. HP equipped the laptop with an HDMI port, one USB-C port, two USB-A ports, an ethernet port, and a headphone jack.\nThe laptop doesn’t have a touchscreen, and our reviewer wasn’t a fan of its display’s 16:9 aspect ratio (it’s easy to get spoiled with 16:10 these days), but its negative qualities are easier to accept when the laptop is $699 ($350 off) at Walmart. Having a machine with a respectable dedicated GPU along for under $700 is impressive. The laptop is also capable of handling day-to-day tasks like streaming videos, putting together slideshows, spreadsheets, and documents, and video chatting with friends and colleagues. \nUpdate, September 17th: Updated pricing and availability, and added deals for HP’s Victus 15 and multiple configurations of Razer’s Blade 16.",

It’s available now in 41mm and 45mm models and starts at $549.99 which is $100 more expensive than the Venu 3.\nFollowing the Venu 3’s introduction of nap tracking the Venu 4 is expanding its sleep tracking by keeping tabs on how consistent your bedtime over the past seven days has been. It can track when health metrics like heart rate, skin temperature, and respiration are outside their typical range while you sleep, potentially indicating elevated stress levels or illness. The Venu 4 can also log lifestyle behaviors like caffeine and alcohol consumption and provide insights into how they may be affecting your sleep and heart rate.\nThe new Garmin Fitness Coach will generate personalized workouts for 25 different activities like cycling, walking, rowing, or a mix of several exercises, based on your past daily activity, your recovery level, and the quality of your recent sleep.\nGarmin introduced a wheelchair mode for the first time with the Venu 3 that counted pushes and added movement reminders. Accessibility is being further expanded with the Venu 4, letting it read aloud the time and health data displayed on its watch face. Color filters have also been added, including grayscale, red/green, green/red, and blue/yellow options, to improve the readability of the Venu 4’s screen for users with color blindness.",

      "raw": "Zoom’s vision of filling meetings with AI clones has nearly arrived. On Wednesday, the video conferencing app announced that you’ll soon be able to create a “photorealistic” avatar of yourself in case you aren’t “camera-ready.” That means your AI avatar can appear polished if you’ve just crawled out of bed.\nZoom plans on launching this feature to Workplace users in December, allowing you to generate an AI lookalike based on a photo of yourself that you upload or capture directly in the app. Once Zoom generates your avatar, you’ll be able to “dress” it in different professional outfits. It will track your movement during the meeting as you talk or move around your screen in real life.\nWhile Zoom started letting users deliver prerecorded messages with an AI avatar last year, this takes things further by allowing you to pose as an AI clone in meetings. During an interview on Decoder in June 2024, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan hinted at a future where everyone has a “digital twin,” or an AI agent that uses your likeness to perform tasks and make decisions on your behalf, like attending meetings and automatically answering emails. Zoom may not be quite there yet, but it’s getting closer.\nZoom plans on rolling out some safeguards with its photorealistic avatars feature, which means you shouldn’t be able to attend your meetings as Keanu Reeves. Smita Hashim, Zoom’s chief product officer, tells The Verge that the platform will use “live camera authentication” to ensure that you’re the person in the image you’ve uploaded. Zoom will also include “in-meeting tile notices” that indicate you’re using an AI avatar. “This feature remains in development, and specific enrollment and authentication processes may change before general availability,” Hashim said.\nAlong with photorealistic AI avatars, Zoom is launching some other updates to the platform, including real-time voice translation. When the update is released in December, it will use AI to translate what a speaker is saying in real time, allowing participants to hear the speaker talk in the language of their choice. The feature currently supports English, German, Chinese, French, Spanish, Arabic, Japanese, Portuguese, and Italian.\nZoom is also releasing a new version of its AI assistant, which can do things like schedule meetings for you and create video clips. This month, Zoom will give users the ability to “bring” the assistant to in-person meetings and conferences on other platforms like Microsoft Teams and Google Meet, where it can take notes.",

      "raw": "I have bad news for ecosystem straddlers who use Google Nest products in their smart homes but rely on iPhones and Apple Home for control: the much-loved Starling Home Hub has been discontinued. \nIn a message on its website, Starling said it can no longer manufacture the hub due to “rapidly rising costs of doing business for small US-based product companies like us (most significantly, tariffs the US government charges us to obtain the components we need to build our product).”\nThe Starling Home Hub launched in 2019. At $99, it was billed as an independent bridge that let you control and automate Nest devices — including thermostats and cameras — in the Apple Home app and with Siri. It also supported local streaming for cameras, improving latency.\nGoogle’s Nest devices have never had direct integration with Apple’s HomeKit platform. While Matter adoption has helped — newer Nest thermostats now work in Apple Home — older models and all cameras still remain outside Apple’s ecosystem.\nFor many users, the Starling Home Hub filled that gap as a more focused, plug-and-play option than setting up a Homebridge server. It earned a reputation as both reliable and indispensable. Now it’s gone.  \nIf you already own one, you’re safe for the time being. Starling says it will continue to provide tech support and roll out security and bug fix updates, and hopes to have enough stock on hand to honor warranties. It’s unclear what’s next for the company, which to date has only produced this one device. The Verge has reached out for comment.\nIn terms of alternatives, the 2020 Google Nest Thermostat and the fourth-generation Nest Learning Thermostat both support Matter, allowing some control in the Apple Home app. Camera support for Matter is slated to arrive later this year, and with Google rumored to be launching new Nest cams next month, that may provide a path to streaming them in Apple Home. But even if Google adds Matter support to its new cameras and doorbell, we don’t know if it will extend that to existing devices.\nFor now, the hub is gone — and so is a simple way to bring Google Nest products into Apple’s smart home ecosystem.",

Starting with the 2026 budget, this pathetic ceremony will no longer be funded by taxpayers’ money. Under my watch, Israeli citizens will not pay from their pockets for a ceremony that spits in the faces of our heroic soldiers.”\n Continue reading...",

      "raw": "AI-generated ads could appear across Amazon’s website and within its other services.\t\n\nAmazon is opening the door to even more AI ads by offering sellers access to a new chatbot that can generate promos with a simple text prompt. With the new tool, Amazon sellers can describe the type of ad they’d like to see, and the AI chatbot will draw from a seller’s brand guidelines, product pages, and other store details to generate a concept, whether it’s for a static advertisement or a video ad.\nAn example shared by Amazon shows how sellers can go from asking the AI chatbot to create taglines and images for a product, to having it write a script, add music, generate a voiceover, and lay out a storyboard. “This tool reduces the time and cost of designing creative ads, encouraging advertisers to explore and experiment rapidly,” Amazon writes. The ads can appear on Amazon’s online marketplace and across its other properties like Prime Video, the Kindle, and even Twitch.\nThe tool is similar to the AI chatbot-style interface that advertisers on TikTok can use to generate video ads.. It also builds on Amazon’s existing AI tools, which already let sellers generate AI videos showcasing their products. Amazon says its AI chatbot is still in beta and runs Amazon’s Nova AI model, as well as Anthropic’s Claude.\nAmazon is adding new “agentic” capabilities to its AI-powered seller assistant as well, allowing it to monitor inventory levels and provide information about how a seller can “optimize” their business by flagging items that are slow to sell or suggesting price changes. The seller assistant can now scan a seller’s account for product listings that may violate new product safety policies, too, in addition to suggesting new types of products to sell based on customer behavior.",

      "raw": "It’s been almost a decade since former Blizzard chief creative officer Rob Pardo launched a new studio called Bonfire Games — and now it’s finally showing off its very first game.\nIt’s called Arkheron, and looks a bit like a multiplayer take on Diablo. In each match, 15 teams made up of three players compete to ascend a tower, and they can collect and loot items that give them special powers. It seems the idea is to build your load-out and strategy on the fly in each match.\nThere’s no word yet on when the game will launch, but an open alpha playtest is happening this weekend, from September 19th through the 21st. You can sign up to check it out on Steam right now.\nAs for why the game took so long following the formation of the studio, Pardo wrote a lengthy blog post explaining the multiple rounds of iteration and revision the game has gone through. The combat, for instance, was redesigned four different times before they got things right. It sounds a lot like the way Blizzard used to work. As Pardo writes:\n As we playtested Arkheron internally, something rare happened. The team fell in love with the game. That might sound obvious, but for experienced developers it isn’t. Many of us have been through projects where the work is meaningful, but the daily playtests feel like a chore. With Arkheron it was different. People didn’t want to miss a session. They got frustrated if servers went down on a holiday. They grumbled when a playtest was canceled. \nHe notes that the alpha will be a little rough arounds the edges, but that that’s all part of the process. “Playtesting is how we make Arkheron better,” Pardo wrote. “It’s how we’ll continue to play the game to make the game, listen to our community and let the fun guide us toward launch.”\nWhenever it does launch, the game will be coming to PC, Xbox, and PS5.",
