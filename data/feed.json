      "raw": "Charlie Kirk, the influencer and activist who co-founded right-wing group Turning Point USA, has died at the age of 31 after being shot while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University, according to his spokesperson Andrew Kolvet, speaking to the New York Times. Deseret News had earlier reported Kirk’s death, according to Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, and President Donald Trump said Kirk is dead in a post on Truth Social at 4:40PM ET.\nAt a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said that “we have a person of interest in custody,” minutes after FBI Director Kash Patel tweeted an announcement that “The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody.”\nJust before 8PM ET, Kash tweeted again, saying, “The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement. Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency.”\nFollowing the shooting, videos on social media seemed to show the arrest of an alleged suspect. Utah Valley University initially said that a suspect was in custody, but Deseret News reported that, according to officials, the status of the shooter is unclear. A spokesperson has also told the New York Times that a person taken into custody after the shooting was not actually the shooter.\n\nAccording to media reports, he appeared to have been hit in the neck. A spokesperson for the university, Ellen Treanor, said in a statement that “shots were fired from a building about 200 yards from the speaker.” The school later said its campus will be closed through Sunday, September 14th.\nUtah Valley University:\nOn behalf of Utah Valley University, we are shocked and saddened by the tragic passing of Charlie Kirk, a guest to our campus. Our hearts go out to his family. As we grieve with our students, faculty, and staff who bore witness to this unspeakable tragedy, UVU campuses will be closed from September 11-14.\nAt the time of the shooting, Kirk was speaking at the first event of a scheduled 15-stop American Comeback Tour, and seated at a “Prove Me Wrong Table” taking questions from the crowd, according to the New York Times.\nUpdate, September 10th: Added the latest information about a person of interest who was interrogated and released.",

      "raw": "Horrifying videos of influencer and right-wing activist Charlie Kirk being fatally shot were widely available on social media platforms. We’ve reached out to some of the platforms to ask how they will be treating the videos and charged posts about the shooting. So far, we’re aware of responses from Bluesky, Meta, Reddit, and YouTube.\nBluesky:\n“Glorifying violence or harm violates Bluesky’s Community Guidelines,” Bluesky said on its Bluesky Safety account. “We review reports and take action on content that celebrates harm against anyone. Violence has no place in healthy public discourse, and we’re committed to fostering healthy, open conversations.”\nMeta:\nSpokesperson Francis Brennan referred The Verge to the company’s policies on violent and graphic content, which Brennan indicated would apply in this case. According to those policies, “we remove the most graphic content and add warning labels to other types of content so that people are aware it may be sensitive before they click through. We restrict the ability for younger users to see content that may not be suitable or age-appropriate for them. By doing so, we aim to provide an appropriate user experience, while continuing to provide space for our users to express themselves.”\nReddit:\n“Our sitewide rules prohibit encouraging, glorifying, inciting, or calling for violence,” spokesperson Gina Antonini tells The Verge. “We’re monitoring the platform to remove violating content, including hashing to prevent its re-upload. We have also reached out to ensure moderators understand and abide not only by the Reddit Rules, but also our Moderator Code of Conduct, and understand the tools and resources available to uphold our policies.”\nYouTube:\n“Our hearts are with Charlie Kirk’s family following his tragic death,” spokesperson Jack Malon tells The Verge. “We are closely monitoring our platform and prominently elevating news content on the homepage, in search and in recommendations to help people stay informed.”\nMalon says that YouTube will be removing “some graphic content” related to Kirk’s death, “particularly if it does not provide sufficient context for viewers.” Some content that shows the attack will be age-restricted, meaning that it can’t be seen by signed-out viewers or users under 18.\nMalon also says that YouTube’s policies prohibit content “reveling in or mocking the death or serious injury of an identifiable individual.”\nDiscord, TikTok, and X didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from The Verge.\nUpdate, September 10th: Added statement from a Reddit spokesperson.",

      "raw": "President Donald Trump has cast his shadow over the latest forecast on US greenhouse gas emissions. Reductions in planet-heating pollution are already expected to slow over the next decade, setting the US and the world back in efforts to stop climate change.\nHere’s what could have been. Taking previous climate policies into account, research firm Rhodium Group forecast last year that US greenhouse gas emissions would fall by up to 56 percent by 2035. Alas, fortunes have changed. Following “the most abrupt shift in energy and climate policy in recent memory” during the first seven months of the Trump administration, according to a new Rhodium Group report published today, we can expect a significantly slower pace of progress — a 26–35 percent reduction in emissions over the next decade compared to pollution levels in 2005. \n\nThat falls far short of the action needed to stop global temperatures from rising\n\n\nThat falls far short of the action needed to stop global temperatures from rising, a problem that is already leading to more extreme weather and other climate-related disasters across the US. The gloomier outlook reflects obstacles the Trump administration has created for wind and solar energy in the US on top of sweeping efforts to wipe federal environmental protections off the books. \nIt’s been a whiplash change since 2024. Former President Joe Biden set a goal of slashing US greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent this decade as part of the nation’s commitment to the global Paris climate agreement. The Inflation Reduction Act Biden signed into law in 2022 was projected to get the US most of the way to that goal, with generous tax incentives for carbon pollution-free energy and electric vehicles projected to shrink emissions about 40 percent by 2030. The Environmental Protection Agency under Biden also introduced policies to strengthen limits on pollution from power plants and transportation. \nTrump has done the opposite. With the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump is phasing out tax credits for electric vehicles and solar and wind projects. He’s been particularly combative with wind energy developers, going as far as to order a nearly complete project off the coast of Rhode Island to halt construction over purported national security concerns. \nThe EPA, meanwhile, no longer wants to regulate greenhouse gas emissions at all. In July, it proposed rescinding the landmark 2009 finding that allows the agency to regulate gases under the Clean Air Act because they endanger public health. The EPA says that if they finalize the rule change, which faces legal challenges, it would “repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice.” \nTrump, after receiving tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry, tapped a former oil and gas company executive, Chris Wright, to lead the Department of Energy. This week, Wright called efforts to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions — which researchers have found needs to happen by the middle of this century to stop global average temperatures from rising much higher than they already are — a “colossal train wreck” and a “monstrous human impoverishment program.” The US, however, has managed to maintain economic growth while limiting greenhouse gas emissions. US greenhouse gas pollution was 17 percent lower in 2022 than they were in 2005, according to the EPA. \nRhodium Group’s emissions forecast includes a range of outcomes based on whether Trump’s proposed policies come to fruition, as well as other economic factors, including oil and gas prices and costs for clean energy technologies. Even without subsidies, renewable energy is still cost competitive with gas, Rhodium Group notes. Wind and solar and related energy storage projects make up a staggering 95 percent of new electricity generation capacity queued up to connect to power grids in the US. With electricity demand suddenly on the rise because of data centers, AI, and electric vehicles, utilities are racing to add as much capacity as they can. In short, renewables aren’t going away in this forecast and will continue to cut down US greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut that’s likely to happen at a slower pace as the Trump administration works to push the scales in favor of more fossil fuels to meet that growing electricity demand. US greenhouse gas emissions have shrunk by an average of 1.1 percent annually since 2005, according to Rhodium Group. In the firm’s most pessimistic scenario, that could fall in half to a pace of just a 0.4 percent reduction each year through 2040.",

      "raw": "The iPad is still the best tablet on the market. | Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge\t\n\nThere are no bad iPads. That’s the best news about Apple’s tablet lineup: 15 years after Steve Jobs first debuted the device, the iPad is the best tablet on the market, and it’s not particularly close. Apple’s App Store is enormous and filled with great apps, Apple’s performance and battery life are consistently excellent, and the iPad is still the company’s most versatile device. That’s one easy answer to your question: yes, if you want a tablet you should buy an iPad. Even last year’s iPad, or heck, last-last year’s iPad is still a solid device. Buying an older but better device — last year’s Pro instead of this year’s Air, for instance — is a tried and true iPad formula.\nBut which of all those good iPads should you buy? That’s never been more complicated. Apple sells six different iPads — the Pro in two sizes, the Air in two sizes, the Mini, and the regular ol’ iPad — all of which come with different specs and accessory options. It’s all too much.\n \n\nThe best iPad value\nThe best long-term iPad\nThe best iPad, period\nThe best iPad Mini\nAn aside on specs and extras\nWhat’s coming next\n\nI’ve tested every iPad currently on the market and have been an iPad user and reviewer since the very first model. (I’m pretty sure I got a job in 2010 because I had a brand-new iPad with me at the interview, but that’s another story.) After using all these tablets and accessories, I think I can help you make the choice.\nThe simplest way to pick an iPad is by process of elimination. First, there’s your budget: you can spend $350 on an iPad, you can spend $2,728 on an iPad Pro, or you can spend just about anything in between. You should also decide whether you need an Apple Pencil and which one has the features you need, because not every iPad supports every model. The same goes for the keyboard attachments. Between price and accessories, your choice might be instantly obvious.\nMore broadly, though, your iPad-buying journey starts with two crucial questions. The first is: what kind of iPad user are you? There are roughly two types. The first and most common iPad user mostly uses it like a larger iPhone: it’s a bigger screen on which to send emails, do the crossword, watch Netflix, and other fairly casual activities. The second type of iPad user, on the other hand, uses it like a touchscreen Mac: it’s for video editing, 3D modeling, creating presentations, crushing spreadsheets, and generally Doing Work of all sorts. You’ll also email and Netflix, of course, but you want your iPad to be a primary computing device. \nI think most people fall into the first category. (Honestly, I also think a lot of people who believe they fall into the second category… mostly don’t.)\nThe second question is more complicated to answer, and it’s what makes the iPad-buying process so tricky right now: how long do you expect to keep your iPad? If you’re looking for a device for the kids to beat up or something that will be your travel companion until you inevitably leave it somewhere, you’re going to end up with a very different device than if you’re shopping for your main computer for the next decade. In general, if you take care of your iPad, I think you can reasonably expect it to last at least five years — so that’s the timeline I have in mind as we go through this guide. \nI used to say that almost everyone should just get the base iPad. Now, I think there are two options worth seriously considering. No matter which one you choose, all the models on this list will receive Apple’s iPadOS 26 update, which launches on September 15th (and may be out by the time you read this).\nThe best iPad value\nApple iPad (11th generation)\nApple’s 11th-gen iPad is the successor to the previous 10-gen model. It has a new A16 chip and few other changes — and is the only Apple tablet to not support Apple Intelligence.\n\n\nScore: 6\n\nProsCons\n\n\nThe cheapest iPad by far\nComes in lots of fun colors\nPlenty capable for casual use\n\nThe worst screen in the lineup\nMuch older chip\nNo Pencil Pro support\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349 $299 at Amazon (128GB, Wi-Fi)\n $349 $299 at Walmart (128GB, Wi-Fi)\n $349 $299 at Best Buy (128GB, Wi-Fi)\n\nScreen: 11-inch, 2360 x 1640 resolution / Processor: Apple A16 / Storage: 128GB to 512GB Port: USB-C / Cellular: 5G (optional) / Speakers: stereo / Compatible accessories: Apple Magic Keyboard Folio, Apple Pencil (USB-C)\nApple’s base model is still a really good tablet and a pretty good deal: you could buy the $349 tablet and the (wildly overpriced but still very nice) $250 Magic Keyboard Folio for the price of the iPad Air. Now that it comes with at least 128GB of storage, I have few complaints with this device.\nThe 11-inch screen is the right size for most iPad things, the camera is good and is located in the right place, it supports the Apple Pencil — though not the newer Pencil Pro — and even its A16 chip is plenty for most casual iPad uses. All the other iPads have slightly nicer screens, particularly the antireflective coating that helps mitigate glare, but that’s almost certainly not worth the additional price for most buyers.\nHere’s my reservation: the base model iPad is further behind the Air than ever before, and I worry about how that’ll play out over the next few years. If you decide to start using your iPad for more creative tasks, then you might regret not getting the Air’s M3 chip. If, by some miracle, Apple Intelligence becomes awesome in the next few years, you won’t be able to use it. \nIf you only wanted an iPad to last a couple years, for everyday iPad tasks, I’d tell you to buy this one without a second’s hesitation. But there’s a chance this one will feel old and outdated long before the Air does.\nRead our full iPad (11th-gen) review.\nThe best long-term iPad\n11-inch iPad Air M3\nThe latest 11-inch iPad Air features Apple’s fast M3 chip with GPU upgrades like dynamic caching for smoother performance in demanding apps. It also supports the Apple Pencil Pro and the new Magic Keyboard, which features a larger build and a 14-key function row. Read our review.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nM3 chip is fast\nExcellent accessory support\nBetter display than the base model\n\nHas Touch ID, not Face ID\nMuch more expensive than the base model\nAI is not an upgrade so far\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 $537 at Amazon (128GB, Wi-Fi)\n $599 $549 at Best Buy  (128GB, Wi-Fi)\n $599 at Target (128GB, Wi-Fi)\n\nScreen: 11-inch, 2360 x 1640 resolution; 13-inch, 2732 x 2048 resolution / Processor: Apple M3 / Storage: 128GB to 1TB / Ports: USB-C / Cellular: 5G (optional) / Speakers: stereo / Compatible accessories: Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad Air, Apple Pencil Pro, Pencil USB-C\nThe iPad Air is supposed to be the perfect middle ground of the iPad lineup, and this year’s model gets pretty close. The M3 chip is only a tiny upgrade over the M2 — I don’t even notice it in day-to-day use — but I’ll never complain about having newer chips. The biggest upgrade to the Air this year is actually the new Magic Keyboard, which adds a row of function keys and makes the setup a much more credible laptop replacement. (The new keyboard also works with the M2 Air, and if you can find that device on sale somewhere, it’s still a great tablet.)\nThe base iPad to iPad Air upgrade is straightforward enough. You get better accessories, a somewhat better screen, and a noticeably better processor for $250. (You also get the option of a 13-inch device for another $200, but I think an 11-inch iPad is the right size for most people — the 13-inch models start to feel more like laptops than tablets.) If you’re playing Netflix and browsing the web, that $250 won’t get you much, but as soon as you start noodling around in Final Cut or even GarageBand, you’ll notice the difference. There’s a lot of room to grow into the Air, whereas the base iPad may hit its ceiling much sooner.\nThe other thing the Air offers that the base iPad doesn’t is Apple Intelligence. Right now, this is not a problem: there is exactly nothing in Apple Intelligence worth spending $250 on. But if you’re an AI believer, you should know that the base iPad won’t get whatever’s coming.\nRead our full iPad Air M3 review.\nThe best iPad, period\n13-inch iPad Pro M4\nThe newest iPad Pro comes in either an 11- or 13-inch configuration with Apple’s M4 processor. Both models also feature an OLED display, a much thinner and lighter build, new horizontal placement for the front camera, and support for the Apple Pencil Pro.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nOutrageously powerful\nGorgeous screen and design\nFull accessory support\n\nOutrageously expensive\nLike, MacBook Pro-level expensive\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1299 $1194.5 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi)\n $1499 $1399 at Amazon (512GB, Wi-Fi)\n $1899 $1723 at Amazon (1TB, Wi-Fi)\n\nScreen: 11-inch, 2420 x 1668 resolution 120Hz OLED; 13-inch, 2752 x 2064 resolution 120Hz OLED; nano-texture glass optional / Processor: Apple M4 / Storage: 256GB–2TB / Ports: USB-C / Cellular: 5G (optional) / Speakers: four / Compatible accessories: Apple Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil Pro, Pencil USB-C\nIf you’re not worried about price tags, this is easy: the latest iPad Pro is my favorite tablet of all time. The Tandem OLED screen is bright and crisp, the tablet is barely thicker than its USB-C port, it’s light, it’s thin, and it’s about as well made as you could expect a tablet to be. The M4 chip is plenty fast even for high-end games and ultra-complex creativity apps. It supports the new, lighter, better Magic Keyboard case and the Pencil Pro. I have plenty of qualms about how powerful iPadOS is, and the limits it places on just how powerfully you can use an iPad, but the M4 Pro is everything you’d want in a tablet.\nBut oh boy, the price. The Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model, and if you want a keyboard, a Pencil, and even a single storage upgrade, you’re quickly looking at a $2,000 purchase. If we’re just talking about a Netflix and email machine, we’re long past the point of diminishing returns. But if you don’t care, and you just want the best thing money can buy? Here it is. You won’t be disappointed.\nRead our full iPad Pro review.\nThe best iPad Mini\n2024 iPad Mini\nThe seventh-gen iPad Mini comes with Apple’s A17 Pro chip and support for Apple Intelligence. It’s also compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro and offers faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds. Read our review.\n\n\nScore: 6\n\nProsCons\n\n\nIdeal for one-handed use\nWorks with the Pencil Pro\n\nMissing some accessory support\nCamera’s in the wrong spot\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 $474 at Amazon (128GB, Wi-Fi)\n $599 $574.3 at Walmart (256GB, Wi-Fi)\n $799 $749 at Amazon (512GB, Wi-Fi)\n\nScreen: 8.3-inch, 2266 x 1488 resolution 60Hz Mini LED / Processor: Apple A17 Pro / Storage: up to 2TB / Port: USB-C / Cellular: 5G (optional) / Speakers: quad / Compatible accessories: Apple Pencil Pro, Pencil USB-C, Smart Folio\nYou’re either an iPad Mini person or you’re not. I very much am: I’ve used a Mini for years as my device for reading in bed, watching movies on airplanes, and playing games on the go. The latest Mini is a bit of a disappointment, with a slightly underpowered processor and an old design that could have used smaller bezels and a relocated camera. But it’s still the iPad Mini, and it’s still good enough for most tablet things. If you want an iPad Mini, this is it.\nRead our full iPad Mini review.\nAn aside on specs and extras\nOnce you’ve picked an iPad model, you still have a bunch of decisions to make. And many of them are about specs and features that will cost you hundreds of dollars. Here are my recommendations for some of the things you’ll encounter:\nCellular coverage: You probably don’t need this. Unless you live in a really remote place, Wi-Fi is available in most places. That said, I’ve found that I use cell-equipped iPads far more often when I can just pull them out and know they’re connected — there’s something about busting it out in the park or on the subway that just feels great. Plus, it’s a really useful hotspot for other devices. This isn’t the first place I’d spend my money, though.\nStorage: This is the first place I’d spend my money. All the iPads now come with at least 128GB of storage, which is a big upgrade — 64GB was just never enough. Even now, though, I recommend springing for 256GB if you can afford it; you’d be surprised at how quickly your photos, videos, and Netflix downloads add up.\nEngraving: Don’t do this. It screws up returns and makes selling or giving it away harder. Just don’t do it.\nApple Pencil: As much as I’d love for this to be an all-purpose accessory, it’s really not. Buy it (either the USB-C or the Pro) if you plan to handwrite or draw a lot. Otherwise, skip it.\nMagic Keyboard: This is the first accessory I’d recommend to most people — many people type a lot on their iPads, and it’s also a handy stand and dock for the tablet. You can find cheaper keyboard docks than Apple’s, but I haven’t found one I like better. It’s expensive no matter which model you buy, though.\nMy gadget shopping advice is always to buy the best thing you can afford and hold it for as long as possible, and that’s more doable with an iPad than almost any other device category. If you have the extra $100 to spend on storage, do it. If you want to upgrade because you think AI will get more powerful in the next few years, go for it! Just make sure you know which kind of iPad user you really are, and get the best one you’ll actually make use of. Hopefully for a long time to come.\nWhat’s coming next\nFor the first time in a while, the iPad lineup feels fairly up to date. The Air, Mini, and base model have all been updated in the last several months. The Pro is actually the oldest device in the lineup, and Bloomberg has reported that an M5-powered Pro could be coming as soon as this year. \nApple does appear to be updating its devices more often than before, sometimes on an iPhone-style annual schedule. Obviously, your iPad doesn’t need to be upgraded that often, and the year-to-year upgrades tend to be small. So our advice still holds: if you need a new one, now’s a good time. If you don’t, there seems to always be an upgrade just around the corner.\nUpdate, September 10th: Adjusted prices and availability.",

      "raw": "The AirPods Pro 3 will hit stores on September 19th for $249.\t\n\nApple’s most impressive wireless earbuds are now available to preorder from Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target for $249. The new AirPods Pro 3 won’t arrive until September 19th, but you can place your order from the retailer of your choice, then be among the first to dig into their premium features on launch day.\nAirPods Pro 3\nThe third-gen AirPods Pro add a new built-in heart rate sensor and live translation feature. They also improve upon their predecessor with twice the noise cancellation, better sound, and a fifth swappable ear tip option.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Best Buy\n $249 at Walmart\n\nWe’ve gone into detail about how the AirPods Pro 3 stack up against the rest of Apple’s AirPods lineup of earbuds and over-ear headphones in our comparison guide. The most notable change is a new built-in heart rate sensor that lets iPhone owners track calories burned and track progress in over 50 types of workouts from the Fitness app. Also of note, Apple claims that the new buds can deliver ANC that’s twice as effective as the last-gen model, while battery life has increased. But there are more features beyond improved bass and better active noise cancellation.\nThe buds’ case is a little lighter, and there’s a fifth ear tip option in the box (XXS) for a more secure, comfortable fit for those with tiny outer ears. To top it off, they feature an improved IP57 rating for dust and water (and sweat) resistance.\nWe’ll be publishing our full review of the AirPods Pro 3 as soon as we can, so stay tuned. In the meantime, be sure to check out our coverage if you’re also looking to preorder the new iPhones or new Apple Watches.",

      "raw": "The AirPods Pro 3 seem like a solid upgrade, but they have one significant drawback: Apple isn’t including a charging cable in the box, MacRumors reports. Apple spells it out right on the AirPods Pro 3 tech specs page, saying in the “In the Box” section, “USB‑C Charge Cable sold separately.” That means that if you want to charge the case for the AirPods Pro 3, you’ll need to use a charging cable you already have, buy a new one, or use a wireless charger.\nFor a lot of people, this may not be a huge issue, especially if you already have a bunch of USB-C cables lying around the house. It’s arguably a little more environmentally friendly, since it might mean fewer people lose or throw away yet another cable.\nBut I’m the type of person who likes to stash away the additional cables I get with my tech, even if I don’t need them at the time — having an extra cable in storage has come in handy more times than I care to admit. And with Apple having already stopped packing in things like wall plugs and headphones with iPhones, now I’m wondering if it may someday stop including a charging cable in the box with iPhones, too.",
