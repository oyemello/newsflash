      "raw": "You can’t set your own Calling Card, but you can use them to customize how other contacts appear when they call you.\t\n\nGoogle’s Phone app is adding “Calling Cards” that let you customize the appearance of contact screens for incoming calls. They’re similar to the Contact Poster feature that iPhone users have had since 2023, allowing Google Phone app users to replace the teeny contact photos that appear when someone is calling you with full-screen images and stylized names.\nThe update is part of Android’s Material 3 Expressive design language overhaul, which Google used to test a revamped Phone app interface in June. Calling Cards started appearing in beta versions of Google’s Contacts and Phone apps earlier this month, but now they’re getting a public release in version v188 of the Phone app. Google says Calling Cards will be available worldwide, and are being rolled out “in phases,” so they might take a while to appear for everyone.\nWhen the feature becomes available, Phone app users will see a banner on the Home tab that reads “Introducing calling card: Customize how you see your contact when they call you.” Tapping on this takes users to the Calling Card page, but you can also navigate to it manually in Contacts. From there, Calling Cards can be created for each contact by selecting an image from the device’s camera, gallery, or Google Photos, and choosing a font and color option that will be used to display the contact’s name.\nUnlike Contact Posters on iOS, you can’t design your own Calling Card that will appear for other contacts when you call them. Google’s Calling Cards only let you set customized screens that are specific to your device, so you’ll have to set these for every individual person if you want to use the feature. Those contacts can’t edit how their Calling card appears on your device, however, so you can have some fun with how you customize them.\nThis is rolling out alongside a new “Take a message” feature for the Phone app that automatically answers and transcribes voicemails when you miss a call. Users can record a custom greeting that callers hear when leaving a voicemail for Take a Message, or select from one of the available greeting presets. Transcripts and voicemail audio can be found in the Phone app Recents tab, and Google says that all messages are “stored privately on your device.” The feature is available on Pixel 4 phones or newer, and on Pixel Watch 2 models or newer when paired with Pixel 6 or more recent Google phone models.",

The two employees, Nisreen Jaradat and Julius Shan, were fired “in connection” with demonstrations that saw protesters set up encampments at Microsoft’s headquarters, according to Hossam Nasr, an organizer with the No Azure for Apartheid group.\nTwo other Microsoft employees were fired last night for their involvement with a protest that saw members of the group gain access to a company building and live stream themselves inside the office of Microsoft president Brad Smith. Jaradat had previously sent a mass email around Microsoft saying she was “fed up” with the company’s treatment of her as a Palestinian worker, bypassing the company’s restrictions on language around Palestine and Gaza internally in order to do so.\nThe No Azure for Apartheid group has been taking public actions against Microsoft throughout the year. The group interrupted Microsoft executives during live streamed presentations on multiple occasions this spring. More recently, the group attempted to occupy a plaza on Microsoft’s headquarters. After being removed, they returned the next day with tents and tables and poured red paint across a Microsoft sign; 18 people were arrested.\nProtesters returned again on Tuesday for the demonstration in Smith’s office. Afterward, Smith held a press conference saying that Microsoft is “working every day” to investigate potential misuse of Azure in Israel. But he said the protesters’ actions were “not ok.”\nMicrosoft declined to provide an attributable statement to The Verge.",

      "raw": "Microsoft’s AI division announced its first homegrown AI models on Thursday: MAI-Voice-1 AI and MAI-1-preview. The company says its new MAI-Voice-1 speech model can generate a minute’s worth of audio in under one second on just one GPU, while MAI-1-preview “offers a glimpse of future offerings inside Copilot.”\nMicrosoft already uses MA1-Voice-1 to power a couple of its features, including Copilot Daily, which has an AI host recite the day’s top news stories, and to generate podcast-style discussions to help explain topics. \nYou can try MA1-Voice-1 out for yourself on Copilot Labs, where you can enter what you want the AI model to say, as well as change its voice and style of speaking. In addition to this model, Microsoft introduced MAI-1-preview, which it says it trained on around 15,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs. It’s built for users in need of an AI model capable of following instructions and “providing helpful responses to everyday queries.” \nMicrosoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman said during an episode of Decoder last year that the company’s internal AI models aren’t focused on enterprise use cases. “My logic is that we have to create something that works extremely well for the consumer and really optimize for our use case,” Suleyman said. “So, we have vast amounts of very predictive and very useful data on the ad side, on consumer telemetry, and so on. My focus is on building models that really work for the consumer companion.”\nMicrosoft AI plans on rolling out MAI-1-preview for certain text use cases in its Copilot AI assistant, which currently relies on OpenAI’s large language models. It has also started publicly testing its MAI-1-preview model on the AI benchmarking platform LMArena.\n“We have big ambitions for where we go next,” Microsoft AI writes in the blog post. “Not only will we pursue further advances here, but we believe that orchestrating a range of specialized models serving different user intents and use cases will unlock immense value.”",

Under the old Preferred Care program, replacing a cracked screen would run you $29. Under Pixel Care Plus a cracked front screen or battery running at under 80-percent capacity will get swapped out for $0. Unfortunately, if you happen to mess up the internal screen on your 10 Pro Fold, you are not covered. \nOther accidental damage fees vary depending on model, ranging from $49 on some older models like the Pixel 8a and 9a, to $99 on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. On average they’re lower though, with service fees reaching $129 for the Pixel 9 Pro and Fold models. The new loss and theft option, which adds $1 or $2 a month to the plan, also varies per model with deductibles ranging up to $149 on the high end. \nThe new plans bring Google more inline with the likes of Samsung, which ditched screen replacement fees under its new extended coverage plans back in January.",

This sports trifecta means you can take advantage of Labor Day sales on 4K TVs, whether you’re planning on hosting big at-home viewing parties, or you just want to tune in alone.\nRight now, you can save hundreds of dollars on high-end OLED TVs like Samsung’s S90D or Sony’s Bravia 8 II. If you don’t want to spend as much, you can pick up a 70-inch 4K TV from Insignia for well under $400. That’s just a taste, but we’ve got more deals below that should suit gamers, cinephiles and sports fans alike. Many of these TVs are at or matching their lowest prices, and, as always, there’s no guarantee that Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals will beat these prices.\nInsignia F50\nInsignia F50\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499.99 $329.99 at Amazon (70-inch)\n $449.99 $319.99 at Best Buy (65-inch)\n $349.99 $189.99 at Best Buy (55-inch)\n\nInsignia’s massive 70-inch F50 4K TV is on sale for $329.99 ($60 off), its lowest price ever at Amazon (that size isn’t available at Best Buy, although plenty of other sizes are). In terms of specs, it’s about as basic as they come, with a 60Hz refresh rate screen and three HDMI 2.0 ports. It’ll be just fine for watching sports and movies on, but 60Hz means it can’t display PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, or Switch 2 games at their fastest-possible frame rates, but 60 frames per second isn’t so bad. The F50 supports HDR10 for more contrast-rich and accurate colors when viewing TV shows, movies, or games that support the format.\nThe TV runs Amazon’s Fire OS, and has Alexa voice capabilities built into its included remote, so you can use your voice to search for content. You can also utilize Alexa to change the TV’s volume and input without manually navigating through menus. If you have an Alexa-enabled camera, such as the Blink Mini, you can ask it to fetch a live video feed, which will appear as a picture-in-picture frame at the top of the TV screen. The F50 also supports AirPlay, so you can mirror your Apple device’s display onto the TV. It doesn’t have every bell and whistle, but Insignia’s F50 is a solid 4K TV, especially considering its size and price. If you want a smaller TV, Amazon and Best Buy are offering the 55-inch model for $189.99 ($160 off), which matches its all-time low price. \nTCL QM6K\nTCL QM6K 4K QLED TV\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $598.99 $446.99 at Amazon (55-inch)\n $598.99 $449.99 at Best Buy (55-inch)\n\nIf you want a more premium 4K TV than the Insignia model above (without breaking the bank, of course), TCL’s 55-inch QM6K comes with a surprising amount of features for its roughly $446.99 ($350 off) sale price at Amazon, and $449.99 at Best Buy. The TV has a 144Hz panel, which will make fast-paced console or PC games display with fabulous fluidity compared to using a 60Hz screen. It has a full-array local dimming panel for even lighting across all dimming zones (negating the bloom effect that some cheaper TVs exhibit in dark scenes).\nThe TV has two HDMI 2.1 ports, which can carry a 120Hz 4K signal that modern game consoles and PCs can take advantage of. Its two HDMI 2.0 ports top out at 60Hz, which is suitable for a Blu-ray player or perhaps a Google TV 4K Streamer streaming device. The TV runs on TCL’s AIPQ Processor, which the company says analyzes what you’re watching or playing to optimize its brightness, color, and contrast in real time. If you want a larger TV, you can get the 65-inch model for $549.99, which matches its all-time low at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. Interested in the 98-inch model as seen at the top of this post? It’s $1,799.99 at Best Buy (was $2,999.99).\nSamsung S90D \nSamsung S90D TV\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599.99 $1197.99 at Amazon (65-inch)\n $1599.99 $1199.99 at Best Buy (65-inch)\n $1599.99 $1197.99 at Walmart (65-inch)\n\nOLED TVs are more affordable than ever before, and this Labor Day deal on Samsung’s 65-inch S90D is proof. Its price is down to just $1,197.99 ($500 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. The OLED panel is the star spec, of course, delivering better contrast and brightness control than any other type of screen tech. Its other specs are good, too. The TV has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.1 ports, letting consoles and PCs display at 4K/120Hz. It runs on a processor that can upscale non-4K video to look better on a higher-resolution set, and can analyze what you’re watching to make objects in the foreground look closer than the background. The S90D doesn’t support Dolby Vision (typical with Samsung TVs, unfortunately), but does have HDR+ for more accurate color. \nThe TV has Amazon Alexa built-in, and it runs Samsung’s Tizen operating system, so you can access TV shows and movies with your voice using a microphone built into the remote. The S90D can also access Samsung’s Gaming Hub, which allows you to play games from your Steam library directly from the TV (via Wi-Fi or ethernet) rather than manually connecting it to a PC. \nIf you want an even larger OLED TV, the 77-inch S90D is around $1,797.99 ($602 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. \nSamsung The Frame TV Pro\nSamsung The Frame TV Pro\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2197.99 $1797.99 at Amazon (65-inch)\n $2199.99 $1799.99 at Best Buy (65-inch)\n $2197.99 $1797.99 at B&H Photo (65-inch)\n\nSamsung’s The Frame TV Pro can display artwork when you’re not actively watching video or playing games on it, and the 65-model for an all-time low price of around $1,798.99 ($401 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The TV’s standout feature is its “Art Mode,” which allows you to display an image from Samsung’s Art Store. The store has over 2,000 images, including classics like Van Gogh’s The Starry Night, and requires a subscription that costs $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year. \nAnother interesting aspect of the Frame TV Pro is that you don’t need to connect video sources directly to it. Samsung’s Wireless One Connect Box contains four HDMI 2.1 ports, and sends an audio and video signal wirelessly from devices to the TV. Samsung also includes a wall mount with the Frame TV Pro. \nThe Frame TV Pro has a 120Hz panel, making it great for fast-moving games and other high frame rate content. Plus, its processor can upscale lower-resolution video, and can automatically adjust video settings based on what you’re watching and your environment. The Frame TV Pro has a matte display, which won’t show glare from light sources as much as an LCD or OLED screen, so the image on screen will look a little more canvas-like. The TV also has a thick white bezel around the screen, and you can pick up an optional frame to fit around the outside to make it look even more like a painting. \nFor a bigger model, the 75-inch Frame TV Pro is $2,497.99 ($700 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.\nSony Bravia 8 II\nSony Bravia 8 II\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2999.99 $2298 at Amazon (55-inch)\n $2999.99 $2299.99 at Best Buy (55-inch)\n $3499.99 $2998 at Amazon (65-inch)\n\nSony’s Bravia 8 II was recently voted the best TV of 2025 by a panel of experts (including The Verge’s Nilay Patel), and the 65-inch model is matching its all-time low price of around $2,998 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. The 4K OLED has a 120Hz panel, and its custom AI processor optimizes its color and contrast based on what you’re watching and playing. It has two HDMI 2.1 ports (which take full advantage of its refresh rate) and a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports that top out at 4K/60Hz.\nSony says the Bravia 8 II has studio calibration modes for Netflix, Prime Video, as well as its own Sony Pictures Core streaming service. The panel who favored the TV were comparing images on the Bravia 8 II against a $43,000 Sony reference monitor. Based on its performance in those tests, we’re confident the Bravia 8 II can display video better than top OLED TVs from Samsung, LG, and Panasonic. Although, you’ll pay a heftier price for it.\nThe TV has Google Assistant built in, can be controlled by an Alexa-enabled speaker, and supports AirPlay 2. Sony has also discounted the 55-inch model to around $2,298 ($701 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.",

      "raw": "Our picks include carrying cases and ones you can leave on during handheld and docked play. | Image: The Verge, Getty Images\t\n\nYou might find it kind of sad to put your hard-earned Switch 2 into a protective case. To me, it’s freeing. Using a case relieves me of the worry that it will accumulate tons of little scratches, or worse. I’ve tested several types of cases on the Nintendo Switch 2 since its June 2025 debut, including flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I’ve also tested carrying cases that protect the console when it isn’t in use.\nIt didn’t take long for me to find one that I think is the best, but that hasn’t stopped me from trying new options from brands that are familiar, as well as from companies that aren’t household names. There’s something for everyone — and every budget — below.\nI just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. However, the bar for carrying cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables, cartridge storage, or ideally both.\nAs for my favorite case, I didn’t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that’s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the Dbrand Killswitch is the best model overall. I published a full review of the Killswitch, but the skinny is that while it’s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost.\nThe best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play\nDbrand Killswitch – Switch 2\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nVery secure fit\nMakes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways)\nClever dock adapter\n\nChunky dock adapter\nNot the most affordable case\nFront protection only comes in the $80 tier\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 at Dbrand\n\nThe least expensive Killswitch tier costs $59.95 and includes a set of Joy-Con 2 grips, a rear cover for the console and a small matching piece to adhere to its kickstand, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes one of Dbrand’s skins. There’s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it’ll incidentally wiggle off. \nUnfortunately, the protective case makes it impossible to fit the Switch 2 into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into the dock, essentially acting as a USB-C extender. It’s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2’s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock’s plastic wall. It’s a little clunky, but I’m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality.\nThe tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent cover that protects the front of your console when you aren’t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover.\nWhen this guide was first published, Dbrand was in the midst of updating its Killswitch so that it wouldn’t allow the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without you pressing their release buttons. Basically, if you held your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion was likely to detach, potentially causing serious damage to the console. Dbrand redesigned the Joy-Con 2 grips to fix the issue, and previous buyers can request a replacement free of charge. Future buyers will receive the Killswitch with the updated, improved grips. We’ve received the tweaked pieces and can confirm that they fix the issue.\nRead my full review of the Dbrand Killswitch case for the Nintendo Switch 2\nRunner-up\nJSAUX Split Protective Case\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $26.99 at Amazon\n $29.99 at Jsaux\n\nThe Jsaux Split Protective Case is an affordable alternative to Dbrand’s Killswitch, costing $29.99 but with many of the same characteristics. It includes two Joy-Con 2 grips that let you detach them from the system at will, and a transparent shell to clip around the back and the top and bottom edges of the Switch 2. Unlike the Killswitch, however, the Jsaux shell is so thin that the console can still fit into the dock. It also comes with a hard front cover that protect the screen during transit (or just for safekeeping), and it has storage for 10 Switch cartridges on its underside.\nI’ve got minor qualms with Jsaux’s case, which I can overlook given its low price (and may not be an issue for you, anyway); the Joy-Con 2 grips are smaller, and don’t add as much bulk or grip as Dbrand’s Killswitch, but they’re still serviceable. Also, its build quality isn’t as good (for instance, on my review unit, there was a little bit of warped plastic that looks like a raised eyebrow near the power and volume buttons, though it’s hard to say if this affects multiple units). \nLastly, the design of its Joy-Con 2 grips exhibit the same edge case issue that Dbrand’s model initially faced before it issued a free fix to all owners. If you hold the Switch 2 by either Joy-Con and shake the console’s full weight downward, the force may be enough to completely detach it, sending the console down to the ground. In my testing, it was really difficult to get the Switch 2 to fall, so this hopefully shouldn’t impact many people, but it’s worth mentioning nevertheless.\nThe best carrying cases for the Switch 2\ntomtoc slim carrying case for the Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $47.99 $31.49 at Amazon\n\nTomtoc’s FancyCase Slim case has recently become my favorite Switch 2 zip-up case. Starting at around $33 and going up to $39 depending on the style that suits you best, it’s not the most affordable option. But it’s worth the cost if you want better protection than either the PowerA or Belkin cases below can provide. It has less give in its middle section by comparison. Another thing that sets it apart are the bulbous sections on the outer cover, which offer more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2’s analog sticks, ensuring they don’t get pressed while your console’s inside. Oh, and it includes color options that look like ice cream sandwiches.\nThe FancyCase Slim case is the best option I’ve tried not just for durability but also for a dash of style. That said, it’s short on other perks to justify the price. While Belkin’s Switch 2 carrying case features a pocket for storing microSD Express cards, a cable, or any other small trinket like an AirTag to track its location, the only thing inside of this one is a soft screen-protecting flap that can hold 12 Switch cartridges on the other side.\nRunners-up\nWaterField Designs CitySlicker case for Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 at WaterField Designs\n\nWaterField Designs has been making tweaks to its beloved, but pricey CitySlicker case for every major handheld to come along. For fans of the case, or those who are looking for a more premium option, the $129 Switch 2 version doesn’t change what isn’t broken. The City Slicker hugs the console’s curves closely enough to ensure a snug fit with a fleece interior, flanked by two pockets for cables and small accessories — one in front of where the Switch 2 sits, and one behind it. There’s a larger zip-up mesh pocket on its back.\nHigh-quality materials set this case apart from the others on this list, and unsurprisingly are what drives up the cost. It features leather on the flap covering the system and around the front of the case. For the secondary material, you have the option of waxed canvas or ballistic nylon. If you want your Switch 2 to sleep in style, this would make for a great gift to yourself or to another game. However, the City Slicker likely won’t protect your console as much as a tougher zip-up or cover case can. Not to mention, you may prefer a case with more cartridge slots than the five that are punched out of this case’s luxe leather.\nThe next opportunity to pre-order the case will be on September 11th at 11:00am ET.\nPowerA Slim Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $19.99 at Best Buy\n $19.96 at Walmart\n\nPower A’s slim zip-up case for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren’t using it. It’s not a hard case, so it won’t survive catastrophic damage, but it’s a fine choice if you don’t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it’s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried. \nAt just $19.99 (half the cost of Nintendo’s official carrying case), baseline protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this).\nThis case doesn’t suffer from a negative trait that’s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA’s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the others included in this section.\nBelkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 at Amazon\n $29.99 at Belkin\n\nFor $10 more ($29.99), Belkin’s slim case is better-looking than PowerA’s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2’s triggers, and its outer shell it tough enough to prevent most accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade.\nBelkin sells a $69.99 version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it’s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that’s included, so you won’t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.\nThe best grip case for the Switch 2’s handheld mode\nThe Killswitch is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access.\nIf you don’t ever plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console. It will protect every angle of your Switch 2 from dings and scratches, and may even keep it safe in the event of a drop.\nThe $29.99 Spigen Rugged Armor is a suitable option. It fits around nearly every nook of the Switch 2, leaving access to its headphone jack, USB-C ports, and speakers (it doesn’t cover up the air vents either because that’d be silly). It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode. However, as noted, you’ll need to remove the case in order to install the Switch 2 into its dock.\nSpigen Rugged Armor for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $39.99 $29.99 at Amazon\n $39.99 at Spigen\n\nUpdate, August 28th: Verified prices and stock for products mentioned in this post. Also added the Jsaux Split Protective Case and WaterField’s CitySlicker case as recommended options at varying price points. We’re still waiting to receive updated versions of the Genki Attack Vector and Sleeper Case to determine whether they’re worth buying, so for now, we’ve removed them from this post.\nDisclosure: In 2023, The Verge collaborated with Dbrand on a series of skins and cases.",

      "raw": "Look, I sympathize. When General Motors said it would adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) for its electric vehicles back in 2023, we knew this meant adapters. But we never could have imagined how many adapters we would get. \nToday, GM announced three additional adapters to help EV owners charge at home or in public. And while I’m sure that GM thought it was presenting the information as clearly as it could, I can’t help but wonder what normal, non-EV owners must think of all this.\nThe new adapters are intended to help customers transitioning between the old CCS way of charging to a future dominated by Tesla charging. The vast majority of automakers have committed to adopting the NACS standard for charging, acknowledging that Tesla’s Supercharger network is superior to the mostly CCS-equipped third-party charging stations that exist today.\n\nI can’t help but wonder what normal, non-EV owners must think of all this.\n\n\nThe automakers said they would begin manufacturing EVs with NACS ports built in, but non-Tesla EV owners could access Tesla’s Superchargers by using CCS-to-NACS adapters in the meantime.\nBut the changeover has been slow going. The 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 was the first non-Tesla EV to go on sale with a native NACS port. But to the best of my knowledge, there haven’t been any others. GM says its upcoming Cadillac Optiq-V will be its first EV with a built-in NACS charging port, but that vehicle won’t be available until later this year. The 2027 Chevy Bolt will also have a native NACS port, out next year.\nIn the meantime, there’s a growing family of dongles to address this weird, in-between place we’re in right now with EV charging. There’s the typical CCS-to-NACS adapters that most automakers are selling to their customers. And now there’s the NACS-to-J1772 adapter for Level 2 charging — J1772 being the part of the CCS plug used for slower charging. And when GM starts producing EVs with native NACS ports, there will be two more adapters available: J1772-to-NACS dongles for slow charging and CCS-to-NACS ones for fast charging.\nHere’s GM’s infographic that “explains” all this:\nAgain, what’s a normal, non-EV-owning — but perhaps EV-curious — person to think about all this? Are they really going to give up the warm embrace of gas pumps for this adapter hell? Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad that GM is offering more adapters to its customers for added flexibility for all levels of charging. That is undeniably a good thing.\nBut we already know that EV charging can be a bit of a head-scratcher. EV owners have complained about varying charging speeds, non-standardized plug types and networks, a lack of price transparency for public charging, and issues with communication between car and charger. It’s getting better, and most people who do most of their charging at home shouldn’t have too many problems. But if you’re trying to bring new people into the experience, this isn’t helpful.\nI’m worried that the growing list of adapters that EV owners will need to acquire to account for any charging scenario could be a significant roadblock in the path to EV adoption — one that is already littered with significant obstacles. I’m trying to imagine my mother, who owns a Ford Mustang Mach-E and who struggles with the basics of smartphone operation, navigating all these adapters while on the road to Palm Springs to visit her friends.\nIt’s a lot to ask! Let’s hope there’s a whole world of simplified EV charging just over that next hill.",

A 7-year-old budget gaming PC might do the job.\nIf you’re willing to settle for 1080p at 30fps in a online shooter (I won’t judge!) an RTX 2060 or RX 5600 XT or Arc A380 GPU with 6GB of video memory is apparently enough, with 16GB of RAM, 55GB of hard drive space, and a Core i5-8400 or Ryzen 5 2600 or equivalent.\nThat’s even slightly lower than the open beta required, which needed 75GB of storage, and today’s the first time we’re seeing what developers say it’ll take to play at 4K60 Ultra (you’ll want pretty potent CPU and GPU for that). \nThough, BF6 is offering a full complement of Nvidia, AMD, and Intel super-resolution and latency reduction techniques (DLSS 4, FSR 4, XeSS 2) with frame generation if you don’t need a native 4K image.\nUnfortunately, I won’t be able to get my friends to play it with me: they’re boycotting over its lack of Linux support, as BF6’s anti-cheat spares no thought for those of us trying to ditch Windows.
