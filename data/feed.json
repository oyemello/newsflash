      "raw": "EA is promising Battlefield 6 will offer “the best PC experience in the history of the franchise,” including 4K resolution, 21:9 and 32:9 ultrawide monitors, HDR, uncapped framerates, both PS5 and Xbox gamepad support, the ability to create and browse servers, streamer and incognito modes, and more — but it won’t require powerful hardware or even an SSD to get a bare-minimum experience. A 7-year-old budget PC might do the job.\nIf you’re willing to settle for 1080p at 30fps in a online shooter (I won’t judge!) an RTX 2060 or RX 5600 XT or Arc A380 GPU with 6GB of video memory is enough, with 16GB of RAM, 55GB of hard drive space, and a Core i5-8400 or Ryzen 5 2600 or equivalent. \nThat’s even slightly lower than the open beta required, which needed 75GB of storage, and today’s the first time we’re seeing what developers say it’ll take to play at 4K60 Ultra (you’ll want pretty potent CPU and GPU for that). \nThough, BF6 is offering a full complement of Nvidia, AMD, and Intel super-resolution and latency reduction techniques (DLSS 4, FSR 4, XeSS 2) with frame generation if you don’t need a native 4K image.\nUnfortunately, I won’t be able to get my friends to play it with me: they’re boycotting over its lack of Linux support, as BF6’s anti-cheat spares no thought for those of us trying to ditch Windows. I liked the couple hours I spent with the beta, but I do share PC Gamer’s concerns about the size and pace and was glad to hear about the changes.",

Where available, this package includes coverage for network TV-broadcast pro and college football games that might slip through the cracks of other streaming options, while going light on channels that aren’t all about sports:\nAt launch, Fubo Sports will include local broadcast stations owned-and-operated by ABC, CBS and FOX plus additional affiliates in select markets as well as ACC Network, Big 10 Network, CBS Sports Network, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNews, ESPNU, Fox News, FS1, FS2, Fubo Sports Network, ION, NFL Network, SEC Network and Tennis Channel with some network 4K content also available. Access to ESPN’s new direct-to-consumer Unlimited plan, which includes ESPN+, is bundled with a Fubo Sports subscription. Customers in select markets will also receive local broadcast sports channels. Additional networks may be launched.\nTo start, Fubo Sports is only launching in “select markets” where broadcasters own or partner with local affiliates, but the service plans to expand its availability in the future. The “skinny” bundle also comes with all of the content in ESPN’s “Unlimited” $29.99 package, like the network’s 12 channels, and ESPN+ streaming options.\nLast year, Fubo sued Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney, and Fox over plans to create the now-scrapped sports streaming superpower, Venu. Fubo agreed to drop its lawsuit after reaching an agreement to merge with Hulu + Live TV next year, creating a new venture majority-owned by Disney.\nAt $55.99 per month, Fubo Sports sits between the $70 sports-focused plans offered by Comcast and DirecTV, and the $40 bundle with ESPN and Fox One. It also comes with some perks of a standard Fubo subscription, including multiview, a “catch up to live” feature that shows you highlights of a game you’re late to, and unlimited DVR.",

To the company’s credit, in late July, it announced that it would be replacing Pocket with another stalwart of the scene, Instapaper. And, just a month after that, support is already live and available as a free firmware update for all currently supported Kobo readers (and the list is surprisingly long).\nIf you’ve been on the hunt for a Pocket replacement ahead of all your data disappearing on October 8th, Instapaper now seems like the clear front runner if you’re a Kobo user, especially since you don’t need an Instapaper Premium subscription to take advantage. Hopefully the partnership will prove more fruitful than the one with Mozilla which hadn’t seen any significant improvements in years and was nearly killed off in 2023.",

The word processing app will soon automatically save new documents to the cloud, instead of Word users having to enable AutoSave and cloud storage options.\n“We are modernizing the way files are created and stored in Word for Windows,” says Raul Munoz, a product manager on the Office shared services and experiences team at Microsoft. “Now you don’t have to worry about saving your documents: Anything new you create will be saved automatically to OneDrive or your preferred cloud destination.”\nThe change to Word for Windows is being tested with Microsoft 365 Insiders, and the software maker says the change will mean you never have to worry about losing any work and that documents can be accessed across Android and iOS devices or in a web browser.\nNew documents will be saved with a date instead of the existing format that adds a number to the end of a document file name. You’ll be able to change where new documents are created by setting default cloud locations,  and you can also disable the option to create new files in the cloud automatically.\nMicrosoft has been increasingly pushing Word users to save documents to the cloud, with the AutoSave function that stores documents in the cloud by default. The software maker has also been using nag screens in Windows to convince people to enable OneDrive backup settings, which have proved unpopular with Windows users. \nThis latest option to create new files in the cloud automatically adds yet another step to saving files locally if you don’t use OneDrive or other cloud storage. Some Word users have already made their feelings clear about Microsoft’s fresh attempt to get more Windows users to use OneDrive in the comment section of Microsoft’s blog post. “It seems that every few years Microsoft adds yet another step that users have to jump through to get to their files,” said one poster. “It used to be very simple with the C drive being prominently displayed.”",

      "raw": "If you’re considering a gaming laptop, but you understandably don’t want to spend anywhere near $2,000, MSI’s Katana gaming laptop with the midrange RTX 5070 GPU is $1,099 (was $1,499.99) at Walmart. This machine has a lot to offer aside from a solid graphics chip for gaming. It includes a 15.6-inch QHD screen with a 165Hz refresh rate, an Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM (upgradeable, in case you want to add more later on), and a 1TB SSD.\nMSI Katana (2025)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $1099 at Walmart\n\nMost gaming laptops at this price include Nvidia’s less capable RTX 5060, along with an inferior processor. The RTX 5070 (with 8GB of video memory) should let you play most games at the screen’s native QHD resolution with ray tracing settings enabled. But, if games that you’re playing aren’t running as well as you’d like them to, many titles feature the option to turn on DLSS, Nvidia’s AI-powered feature that can greatly boost performance by upscaling lower-res graphics. That, or knock the game resolution down to 1080p instead of 1440p.\nLastly, as part of Intel’s Game Days, you’ll get a free copy of Battlefield 6 with purchase of this laptop. Instructions for redeeming the game (which launches October 10th) are shown in the image gallery on Walmart’s product page. You’ll need to provide proof of purchase to Intel by September 30th, then redeem the code by Halloween.\nOther Verge-approved deals\nIf you’re a fan of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, or perhaps you’ve heard how great the games are but have yet to try them, here’s a chance to get some of them for cheap. The latest Humble bundle features several tiers, each of which include a smattering of Ace Attorney and Mega Man games. They games are redeemable on Steam, and play well on the Steam Deck, among other Windows and SteamOS gaming handhelds. If you click “5 Item Bundle” that costs $5, you can get the original Ace Attorney Trilogy, full of games that originally launched in the US on the Nintendo DS. This bundle also includes Mega Max X Legacy Collection and Mega Man Legacy Collection.\nCostco members in the US can get a special discount on Sony’s last-gen (but still great) WH-1000XM5 over-ear, noise-canceling headphones in black. Through September 7th, you can snag them for $249.99 (originally $399.99), which beats Amazon’s current $298 price. This price is the lowest we’ve seen, beating the previous low of $278 last December. This model is an improvement in a number of ways over its predecessor, the XM4, with a refined design, better sound quality (call quality is better, too), and enhanced active noise cancellation. If you’re deciding between this and the newer $449 XM6, perhaps you ought to give the XM5 a try and potentially put that extra $200 back in your pocket. Read our review.\nIf an affordable 55-inch OLED TV is what you’re after, retailer BuyDig has one. Panasonic’s 55-inch Z85 OLED, which we’ve previously featured in our coverage at $897, is down to just $699. This model includes Amazon’s Fire TV operating system, meaning that no extra device is necessary to begin streaming content from your favorite services. What also makes this a fantastic deal is that this purchase includes Panasonic’s wearable neck speaker (a $178 value) that can be connected to the TV for private listening. This TV likely isn’t as bright as pricier competitors, but it has some good specs, including a 120Hz refresh rate panel with four HDMI 2.1 ports, variable refresh rate, and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility.",
