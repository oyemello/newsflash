      "raw": "There’s already been a number of leaks of upcoming Philips Hue products that are expected to be announced next week ahead of IFA. But one thing that hasn’t been mentioned was support for Matter-over-Thread. While there’s no confirmation that support is coming, there’s compelling evidence to suggest it might be. \nFirst off, packaging for two unannounced bulbs appeared on Amazon, with a Matter logo prominently displayed on the box. While Hue devices have been capable of connecting via Matter using the Hue Bridge as a middleman, they’ve never supported the protocol directly. That’s in part because Matter only works via Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread; Hue has been a Zigbee and Bluetooth-only ecosystem for years.\nThen there’s the since-removed FCC filing discovered by HueBlog. A supposed screenshot of the document shows a label for a new Hue White lightbulb with a Matter setup code under the familiar Bluetooth and Zigbee logos. This almost certainly means the lightbulb will connect directly via Matter. Wired Ethernet would obviously be an odd choice. Wi-Fi is a possibility, but the more logical option would be Thread, which is low-power and can create self-healing mesh networks.\nThe one issue is, there’s no mention of Thread or Wi-Fi in the FCC filing anywhere, only Bluetooth and Zigbee. According to HueBlog, however, one document read (before it was removed), “This product only supports BLE 125k/500k/1M/2Mbps:2402-2480MHz, Zigbee:2405-2480MHz. The other functions, bands and modes was [sic] disabled to use by manufacturer [sic] in the software.” What are those other functions, bands, and modes? It’s not specified in any document I could find, but it’s reasonable to assume the list might include Thread which, like Zigbee, uses the 2.4GHz band.\nPhilips isn’t about to abandon Zigbee for Thread overnight, but this would give users direct access to Hue bulbs from any Matter controller, with the Bridge only needed for some advanced features, like dynamic lighting effects. Plus there’s a growing momentum behind Matter-over-Thread, with Ikea recently announcing over 20 products supporting it.",

      "raw": "Lawyers for Tesla filed a motion in court Friday to throw out a jury verdict that found the company’s Autopilot software had contributed to the death of a woman in a crash from 2019. \nEarlier this month, a jury found Tesla partially responsible for the death of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides, who was killed by a Model S driver who plowed into her and her boyfriend Dillon Angulo. Tesla was ordered to pay the families of the victims $243 million in compensatory and punitive damages, a stunning outcome for a company that has managed to avoid taking responsibility for crashes involving its partially autonomous software. \nIn the filing, Tesla’s legal team said the Model S driver bore all the responsibility for the crash. And they are requesting the court invalidate the verdict, or at least order a new jury trial. \n“The $243 million judgment against Tesla flies in the face of basic Florida tort law, the Due Process Clause, and common sense,” the company’s lawyers write, noting that McGee had pressed the accelerator to override Autopilot in the seconds before the crash. “Auto manufacturers do not insure the world against harms caused by reckless drivers.”\nThe lawyers also claim that the plaintiffs should not have been allowed to enter into evidence statements from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has long claimed that the company’s vehicles are capable of higher levels of autonomy than they actually are. And they called claims about data coverup on the part of Tesla — the company was accused of withholding camera data from police investigating the crash — were false and “inflamed” the jury against the company. \nThe motion was filed by attorneys from Gibson Dunn, a firm that represented Tesla in a lawsuit against a former employee and a tech startup accused of stealing trade secrets for a robotic hand. \nView Link\n\nAngulo-Benavides; 2025-08-29; [de 568] Tesla's Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (32457875.1)\n\n\nUpdate August 29th: A spokesperson for plaintiff attorney Brett Schreiber sent the following statement:\n“This motion is the latest example of Tesla and Musk’s complete disregard for the human cost of their defective technology. The jury heard all the facts and came to the right conclusion that this was a case of shared responsibility, but that does not discount the integral role Autopilot and the company’s misrepresentations of its capabilities played in the crash that killed Naibel and permanently injured Dillon. We are confident the court will uphold this verdict, which serves not as an indictment of the autonomous vehicle industry, but of Tesla’s reckless and unsafe development and deployment of its Autopilot system.”",

It would be a bit depressing, except that the weekend also brings with it some really good deal. For example, you can nab a Hisense S7N 55-inch TV at Best Buy and Amazon for $699.99, a solid $300 off its usual $999.99 and only $11 higher than its all-time low. This is part of the Hisense CanvasTV series, which is designed to hang flat against your wall as if it were a painting and display art or photos when it’s not in use.\nHisense S7N TV\nThis 4K QLED display is designed to hang flat against your wall as if it were a painting and display art or photos when it’s not in use. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999.99 $699.99 at Amazon\n $999.99 $699.99 at Best Buy\n\nThe S7N has a 4K QLED display with an anti-glare coating so that it shows art — or your favorite TV shows — to their best advantage, regardless of your viewing angle. If you plan to use it for gaming as well, it supports variable refresh rate between 48Hz to 144Hz, plus multichannel surround sound (however, you may just want a separate soundbar, since TV audio isn’t immersive). It runs Google TV and offers four HDMI (two of which are HDMI 2.1, which support 4K/120Hz on modern consoles) and two USB ports. And it will only power on when it senses somebody nearby.\nBut, of course, the main attraction of this TV is its ability to mimic a work of art, something that can add a bit of class to your wall. \nOther Verge-approved deals\nOne of the favorite add-ons among The Verge’s crew is Elgato’s Stream Deck, which lets you customize real buttons (as opposed to capacitive) to do a wide range of tasks with just a quick tap. The Stream Deck Neo is a wired command center that comes with eight programmable buttons, will work with Macs and Windows PCs, and is compatible with many apps. It’s now on sale for $79.99 (a $20 savings) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H.\nWoot is having a Labor Day celebration of sorts called Toyapolooza. If you buy four or more items listed in its toy sale, you’ll get an extra 30 percent off — buy 10 or more and get an extra 70 percent off. There’s a lot to choose from, including a Masters of the Universe Power Sword Set ($42), a 30-piece set of National Geographic Building Blocks ($14.99), and a Fisher-Price DC Super Friends Playset ($12.99). \nSpeaking of toys, if you’re into Star Wars Lego models, you can score a Lego Star Wars Tantive IV Build and Display Starship Vehicle at Best Buy for $51.19, approximately $13 less than its usual $63.99 price. This set contains 654 pieces, making it a suitable weekend project.\nSamsung is presenting its latest Unpacked launch event on September 4th, and so it’s running a promotion for anyone who reserves its newest Galaxy Tab devices, sight unseen. If you follow through on your free reservation and buy the product between September 4th and October 5th, you can take advantage of a $50 credit, $150 toward a storage upgrade, up to 20 percent off “select Galaxy devices,” and other offers. For those who are part of the Samsung ecosystem, it may be worth checking out.",
